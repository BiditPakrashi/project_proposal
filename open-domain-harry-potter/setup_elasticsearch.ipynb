       "[{'content': 'Gryffindor is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was founded by Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, and determination, to be sorted into his house. The emblematic animal is a lion, and its colours are scarlet and gold. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as \"\\'\\'Nearly Headless Nick\\'\\'\" is the House ghost.\\nGryffindor corresponds roughly to the element of fire, and it is for this reason that the colours scarlet and gold were chosen to represent the house. The colour of fire corresponds to that of a lion as well, with scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold representing the coat.\\n\\n\\n==Traits==\\nGryffindor\\'s founder, Godric Gryffindor\\nThe Gryffindor house emphasises the traits of courage as well as \"\\'\\'daring, nerve, and chivalry,\\'\\'\" and thus its members are generally regarded as brave, though sometimes to the point of recklessness. Some Gryffindors have also been noted to be short-tempered. Notably, Gryffindor house contributed many members to Dumbledore\\'s Army and the Order of the Phoenix, although this may have been because the main members made it a point not to associate with other houses.\\nAccording to Phineas Nigellus Black, members of other houses, particularly Slytherin, sometimes feel that Gryffindors engage in \"\\'\\'pointless heroics.\\'\\'\" Another Slytherin, Severus Snape, considered many Gryffindors to be self-righteous and arrogant, with no regard for rules.\\n\\n\\n==Reputation==\\nThe lion, symbol of Gryffindor House\\nGryffindors and Slytherins have shared a fierce house rivalry since their founders, Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin, respectively, had a severe falling out over Slytherin\\'s emphasis on blood purity. There might also be an element of feeling wronged, as Harry and his fellow Gryffindors tend to win in a lot of circumstances which, when viewed from a neutral point of view, may be considered unfair. Examples of this include the last-minute points awarded by Headmaster Dumbledore at the Leaving Feast, which conveniently put Gryffindor ten points ahead of Slytherin in the 1991–1992 school year, the fact that no points were deducted for the rule breaking that happened during that night and Harry being permitted by Professor McGonagall to have his own broomstick for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, even though first-years are not normally permitted their own broomsticks because of danger.\\nHouse ghost, Nearly Headless Nick\\nMembers of other houses might have felt that Gryffindor received favouritism, considering that many saw Harry Potter being chosen as the fourth competitor in the Triwizard Tournament as an unfair stealing of Hufflepuff student Cedric Diggory\\'s thunder.\\nOverall, however, the houses of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tended to side with Gryffindor in its rivalry with Slytherin. This was particularly notable during the Second Wizarding War — the members of Dumbledore\\'s Army were from Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw, but the Army lacked any Slytherins. (This, however, could also have been because news of Dumbledore\\'s Army was passed by word of mouth, and Harry, who had initially raised it, did not associate with any Slytherins.) During the Battle of Hogwarts, the Slytherin students left, while senior students from the other three houses remained behind to fight against Lord Voldemort and his army - however, it is also worth noting that while Head of House Professor Slughorn left with his students, he then returned to the castle with reinforcements (possibly including senior students) and with Professor McGonagall and Auror Kingsley Shacklebolt, personally duelled Lord Voldemort. Most of the known Death Eaters (besides Peter Pettigrew, Quirinus Quirrell, and possibly others) have been Slytherin House members, and that might have been another reason as to why the other two houses sided with Gryffindor over Slytherin.\\n\\n\\n==Common Room==\\nThe Gryffindor Common Room is located in one of the castle\\'s towers (Gryffindor Tower), the entrance to which is located on the seventh floor and is guarded by an oil painting of the Fat Lady, who is garbed in a pink silk dress. She permits entry only after being given the correct (regularly changing) password. Behind her painting is a large common room, with a fireplace, and two staircases leading up to the girls\\' and boys\\' dormitories.\\nThere is a charm on the girls\\' staircase that prevents boys from using it; however, there is no such enchantment on the staircase to the boys\\' dormitory, allowing girls to use it whenever they wish, due to the founders\\' belief that girls were more trustworthy. The common room is very comfortable, and members of the Gryffindor house meet there for study groups, celebrations, or relaxation. The walls are lined with portraits, each one depicting a previous or current Head of Gryffindor.\\n\\n\\n==Head of House==\\nGodricGryffindor Founders.jpg|Godric Gryffindor (10th Century)\\nGryffindor lady.jpeg|Gryffindor Lady\\nQuidditch Player portrait.JPG|Gryffindor Seeker\\nGCR Portrait Male 2.jpg|Gryffindor Man\\nGCR Portrait Male 3.jpg|Gryffindor Man\\nGCR Portrait Male 4.jpg|Gryffindor Man\\nMuldoon Cragg.jpg|Muldoon Cragg\\nValeriaMyriadd.png|Valeria Myriadd\\nPrimerafoto.jpg|Minerva McGonagall (1956-1998)\\nThe head of house before and during Harry Potter\\'s time was Minerva McGonagall. Minerva became the head of house possibly in 1956, when she was appointed Transfiguration professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, taking over Albus Dumbledore\\'s previous teaching position when he became Headmaster. It is unknown who later became the head of house when she was made Headmistress in 1998 following the end of the Second Wizarding War.\\n\\n\\n==Known Gryffindors==\\nSworn Knight of the Round Table in King Arthur\\'s royal court, known for his defeat of the Wyvern of Wye.

The French for Gryffindor, \"Griffondor\", is a homophone for the actual beast, Griffon d\\'Or. Similarly, the Italian \"Grifondoro\" is a homophone of Grifon d\\'Oro. Coincidentally, Italy also has a high number of cities and towns which present a golden gryffin in their coat of arms. Examples of this are Agnone, Alessandria, Arzignano and Genoa.\\n\\n\\n==Behind the scenes==\\n*J. K. Rowling was once asked in an interview into which House would she sort British politician and former Prime minister Gordon Brown, were she the Sorting Hat. She jokingly responded that she would sort him into Gryffindor, because of the red colours of his political party, which match the colours of Gryffindor.\\n*Rowling herself was sorted into Gryffindor House on .\\n*Many members of the Gryffindor House seem to have a gift for Transfiguration; Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall were both Transfiguration professors, while the latter was the Head of this House. There are four known Animagi from Gryffindor house: James Potter (a stag), Sirius Black (a dog), Peter Pettigrew (a rat) and Minerva McGonagall (a cat). Gryffindor Hermione Granger was noted to be very talented in Transfiguration from her first class. James Potter\\'s wand was also noted to be good for Transfiguration.\\n**Neville Longbottom was an exception to this \\'rule\\', as Transfiguration was among his worst subjects (Herbology was his best).\\n*In the films, Padma Patil, Parvati Patil\\'s twin sister, is seen as a Gryffindor, while in the books she is a Ravenclaw.\\n*Rubeus Hagrid stated in the first book that all the wizards who went bad were from Slytherin, however, Peter Pettigrew, who was in Gryffindor disproves this. At this point, Hagrid was unaware that Pettigrew was still alive, or that he was working for Voldemort. (It should also be noted that Quirinus Quirrell, a Ravenclaw, was working for Voldemort at the time, although Hagrid was unaware of this as well.) Another reason why this is odd is that, at the time, Sirius Black was believed to have gone bad (Hagrid\\'s comments in the Three Broomsticks prove that he knew nothing of the truth in this instance), and he was also a Gryffindor. So Hagrid would have known of at least one Gryffindor who had \\'gone bad\\'. He most likely did not mention this so that Harry would not try to find out more about his godfather, or it could have been \\'Gryffindor propaganda\\' since Slytherin and Gryffindor are known rivals. It is also possible that Hagrid did not remember these exceptions at the time.\\n*On , the following actors and actresses of the \\'\\'Harry Potter\\'\\' films have been sorted into Gryffindor house:\\n**Evanna Lynch, the actress who portrayed Luna Lovegood.\\n**Bonnie Wright, the actress who portrayed Ginny Weasley.\\n**Tom Felton, the actor who portrayed Draco Malfoy.\\n*The colours and emblems of Gryffindor resemble the . Whether this was intentional on Rowling\\'s part is unknown.\\n*Gryffindor House won the second House Cup in  Pottermore; their reward for winning was Gryffindor-related downloadable material.\\n*Gryffindor\\'s entrance changed locations once throughout the film series. In the first film, the students go down a long hallway to reach the entrance portrait. In the third film, the portrait is located very close to the Grand Staircase. It can only be assumed that this is its location for the rest of the series as the outside of the entrance would not be seen again for the rest of the film series.\\n\\n\\n===Pottermore House Cup===\\n*Gryffindor came second for the first house cup with 74,069,919 house points.\\n*Gryffindor won the second house cup with 48,538,348 points.\\n*Gryffindor came third for the third and fourth house cups with 26,740,444 and 24,610,105 points.\\n*Gryffindor came fourth for the fifth house cup with 27,299,570 points.\\n*Gryffindor came second for the sixth house cup with 32,279,991 points.\\n*Gryffindor came fourth for the seventh and eighth house cups with 49,335,378 points.\\n\\n\\n===Translations===\\nIn translated editions, \"Gryffindor\" remains the same and is used for the Catalan, Croatian, Danish, Faroese, German, Icelandic, Polish, Portuguese (Portugal), Spanish, Swedish, and Vietnamese editions.

       " {'content': 'Slytherin is one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Salazar Slytherin. In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to pick students who had a few particular characteristics he most valued. Those characteristics include cunning, resourcefulness, and ambition. Many Slytherin students tend to clique together, often acquiring leaders, which further exemplifies Slytherin\\'s ambitious qualities. Examples of these include Draco Malfoy’s Gang and the Death Eaters.\\nThe founder highly valued and favoured pure-blood students and the Sorting Hat admitted that it can be a factor when being sorted. Students of any blood status can now be placed in the house. However, a Muggle-Born student from that house is considered to be quite rare.\\nThe emblematic animal of the house is a snake and its colours are green and silver. There were two notable heads of the house; Horace Slughorn took the role twice (first leaving in 1981 and then taking the role again from 1997 until leaving before 2016), and Severus Snape. The patron ghost of the house is the Bloody Baron.\\nSlytherin corresponds roughly with the element of water due to serpents being commonly associated with the sea and lochs in western European mythology, as well as serpents being physically fluid and flexible animals. Similarly, in Celtic mythology, water is seen as a portal to another world, leading some to speculate that the element was chosen to symbolise many Slytherins\\' hope for a pure-blood only community. The colours also correspond with waters around lakes and lochs often being green, and silver being often associated with grey rainwater.\\n\\n\\n==Backstory==\\nThis created great controversy at Hogwarts and it was the root of a feud between former friends Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor. Slytherin later decided to leave the school when an argument started between him and Gryffindor, and they either duelled or started a civil war between the two houses. Such an argument would be forever known as the origin of the feud between their two houses and also made them the houses that are most competitive.\\nWhen Slytherin departed Hogwarts, he would leave behind the Chamber of Secrets with the purpose of an heir opening the chamber one day and unleashing a means of purging the school of those who, in his view, were unworthy to study magic: Muggle-borns. The chamber was opened twice and the monster was killed the second time by Harry Potter in 1992. Slytherin’s views at the time could be attributed to the persecution of witches and wizards at the hand of Muggles during that century.\\n\\n\\n==Traits==\\nSlytherins tend to be ambitious, shrewd, cunning, strong leaders, and achievement-oriented. They also have highly developed senses of self-preservation. This means that Slytherins tend to hesitate before acting, so as to weigh all possible outcomes before deciding exactly what should be done.\\nAccording to Albus Dumbledore, the qualities which Salazar valued in the students he had chosen included cleverness, resourcefulness, determination, and \"\\'\\'a certain disregard for the rules\\'\\'.\" Dumbledore noted that all of these were qualities possessed by Harry Potter, who was a Gryffindor but was almost placed in Slytherin.\\nSlytherins tend to take charge and possess strong leadership skills. They are often self-assured and confident of their own competence and can be very loyal.\\nAnother characteristic some Slytherins share is a tendency towards deep, unrequited love. Severus Snape and The Bloody Baron held abiding but unreturned feelings for Lily Evans and Helena Ravenclaw, respectively. Although some Slytherins, such as Tom Riddle, were incapable of feeling love at all, those that did were known to cherish their passion abidingly and unconditionally, although often tragically due to an inability to act appropriately on their feelings. Interestingly, Bellatrix Lestrange held feelings for Tom Riddle himself, which was a factor in her fanatical devotion to the Death Eaters; although Lord Voldemort was incapable of loving her in return, the existence of Delphini suggests that there was at least some kind of intimacy between them.\\nAlthough Merope Riddle likely never attended Hogwarts and therefore wouldn\\'t have been sorted into Slytherin at all, she was a descendant of Slytherin himself and fit the pattern of those sorted into his house, as she held deep and unreturned feelings for Tom Riddle Snr, who often travelled by her house on his carriage.\\n\\n\\n===Blood purity===\\nSlytherin\\'s founder, Salazar Slytherin\\nThe Sorting Hat claims that blood purity was a factor in selecting Slytherins. It is not the main factor but it suggests that the sorting hat takes into account the lineage of the student as well as traits. Muggle-born Slytherins exist, but are very rare, as noted insultingly by Scabior the Snatcher.\\nThere have also been definite examples of half-bloods sorted into the house, including Tom Riddle, Dolores Umbridge, and Severus Snape. Harry Potter was nearly sorted into Slytherin, but because he asked not to be, he was placed in Gryffindor instead. Also, pure-bloods are not automatically placed in Slytherin. There have been various examples of pure-bloods sorted into other houses; the\\xa0Weasley family, Sirius Black, Neville Longbottom, and James Potter\\xa0were all sorted into Gryffindor house, Ernie Macmillan\\xa0was sorted into Hufflepuff.\\nThe concept of blood purity playing a part in picking students for Slytherin house stems from the founder Salazar Slytherin, who wanted a stricter policy of admission to the school — one limited strictly to pure-blood students. This was contrary to the wishes of the other founders at\\xa0Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, who wanted to accept students of any blood status.\\nIt is important to note that not every student in Slytherin agrees with the idea of blood purity, but every member would still be affiliated with their founder’s reputed views a thousand years later. Since the house would nearly always select students who share his view for that house, many members would still give that impression of that house during their time at Hogwarts. For example, in December 1992, the password for the common room was \"pure-blood\".\\n\\n\\n===Rivalries===\\nSlytherin and Gryffindor are generally rivals in Quidditch and for the House Cup, of which the former had won seven years in a row prior to Harry Potter\\'s arrival at Hogwarts in 1991. It is also rare for Slytherin and Gryffindor students to be friendly with one another, and is also quite common for them to share animosity. There are exceptions, such as Slytherin Merlin who had a friendship with Gryffindor Sir Cadogan and Slytherin Severus Snape\\xa0and Gryffindor Lily Evans, who were best friends until Snape\\'s use of the slur\\xa0\"Mudblood\" as well as his aspirations to be a\\xa0Death Eater caused Lily to sever their ties.\\nTheir rivalry was particularly the case during the First and Second Wizarding Wars. During the second war, no Slytherin student joined the association known as Dumbledore\\'s Army; however, this is likely the fault of Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, and Harry Potter, who only invited people they trusted. The three also shared a deep mistrust of any Slytherins.\\nThere is a terrible tension, rivalry, and dislike among Gryffindors Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ronald Weasly, and Slytherin Draco Malfoy to the point that Hermione even once punched Draco. Also, from the moment Harry and Draco met, they became immediate enemies, which was even before they were sorted into their respective houses.\\nSlytherin\\'s relationship with the other two houses, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, was variable. By the time of Harry Potter\\'s years at Hogwarts, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw were frustrated at Slytherin\\'s seven-year winning streak and readily supported Gryffindor in their efforts to break it, to the extent that they even turned against Harry and his friends when their rule-breaking cost Gryffindor 150 points (and thus the lead) with Slytherin rubbing it in at every opportunity. This persisted generally with Quidditch matches, where Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff supported Gryffindor by default if they were facing Slytherin.\\nWhen Harry was named as a Hogwarts Triwizard champion alongside Cedric Diggory of Hufflepuff, the three other houses assumed he was trying to steal Hufflepuff\\'s glory and supported Cedric as the \\'real\\' Hogwarts champion, though the Slytherin house may have likely only done this out of spite for Harry rather than any actual support for Cedric. After Cedric\\'s death by Lord Voldemort\\'s hands, the Slytherins joined the rest in toasting his memory but some, like Draco Malfoy, were not saddened by his death.\\n\\n\\n==Reputation==\\nA serpent, symbol of Slytherin House\\nSlytherin has a such well-known reputation for creating dark witches and wizards that many would even say that every dark witch or wizard was actually in Slytherin. (It also didn’t help that Voldemort himself was in Slytherin too when he was a student at Hogwarts) While it is true that many were in the house, it is untrue to say every single one of them was, as Peter Pettigrew, betrayer of James and Lily, was in Gryffindor and Quirinus Quirrell was in Ravenclaw.\\xa0\\nIt appears that reputation has led to an ironic prejudice against the entire house. It is unknown how many dark witches and wizards were from this house before Tom Riddle began recruiting Death Eaters but many of them came from a family that valued blood purity and would prefer, like Riddle, to be in the house and recruit from there.\\nIn fairer terms, there were many good witches and wizards in the house who opposed the use of the\\xa0Dark Arts,\\xa0as well as discrimination based on\\xa0blood purity, such as\\xa0Horace Slughorn, Andromeda Tonks, and Leta Lestrange. Andromeda was related to many dark witches and wizards, such as her own sister Bellatrix Lestrange, and brother-in-law Lucius Malfoy, but she chose to forsake the loyalty to her family in favour of marrying the Muggle-born Ted Tonks. Leta was quite different from the majority of her family with her kind - albeit self-deprecating and bitter - personality, her love for both Newt Scamander and Theseus Scamander, her career ambition without ruthlessness, and her self-sacrificing bravery in the face of Gellert Grindelwald, in stark contrast to the the usually compassionate Queenie of house Pukwudgie, who joined Grindelwald rather quickly. Also, the allegiance of Severus Snape\\xa0was found to ultimately be towards\\xa0Albus Dumbledore to the point of serving as a triple agent for the\\xa0Order of the Phoenix, in stark contrast to Peter Pettigrew, the former Gryffindor who became a double agent for the Death Eaters instead. Merlin (of King Arthur fame) was also a Slytherin.\\nIt might also be possible (though quite unlikely) that the Sorting Hat simply sorts anyone with ill intentions into Slytherin, regardless of whether they possess cunning and ambition, which helped to unfairly give this house a bad name. Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle were both incredibly stupid and did not have clever or cunning minds, but were still sorted into Slytherin. They could have possessed one of the minor traits as even Peter Pettigrew was not placed into Gryffindor for bravery, but for chivalry instead.\\nIt is also likely that Crabbe and Goyle were simply placed there by process of elimination, since they exhibited virtually none of the qualities valued by any of the other houses (lacking the work ethic or honesty of Hufflepuff, the academic prowess of Ravenclaw, or the bravery of Gryffindor). The Sorting Hat simply could have took into account what house they wished to be placed in which, with their family history, was most likely Slytherin.\\nThe behaviour of Slytherin house at the Battle of Hogwarts is also debated. The majority of their members departed Hogwarts before the battle started and a few joined their families in becoming Death Eaters. However, many of them returned to Hogwarts to fight against the Death Eaters and were led back by their Head of House, Horace Slughorn.\\nThe traits of the house are considered obvious examples of people turning toward an ill purpose such as cunning and ambition but they are not inherently negative. Furthermore, traits from the rest of the houses such as daring, intelligence, and loyalty can also become easily negative.\\nAnother trait which could be seen as a negative one is self-preservation. The idea that many of them seem to value their own lives more than the lives of others can make them less thought of and trusted, but that is not always the case. Phineas Nigellus gave that impression when he saw Harry Potter trying to run away, because he was afraid that his presence was putting his friends in danger. He stated that \"\\'\\'We Slytherins are brave, yes, but not stupid. For instance, when given the choice, we will always choose to save our own necks\\'\\'\".\\nThere are exceptions to this rule, however, such as Snape, who Harry said was a \"\\'\\'Slytherin and... probably the bravest man I ever knew\\'\\'\"\\'\\',\\xa0\\'\\'and Regulus Black, who gave his life in an attempt to destroy one of the\\xa0Horcruxes of Lord Voldemort and told his house-elf Kreacher to save himself and leave.\\nThe truth is that while most Dark wizards are Slytherins, many members of Slytherin House do not have Dark leanings and are even kind and accepting, while smaller groups of Voldemort\\'s supporters are aligned with other Houses. During the Battle of Hogwarts, while all of the Slytherin students left the school before the fighting started, several of them did return with Professor Slughorn as reinforcements to join the fight against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters, and some decided to fight as a part of Dumbledore’s Army.\\n\\n\\n==Common Room==\\nThe Slytherin common room is in the dungeons of Hogwarts Castle\\xa0and underneath the Black Lake. Because of this, the light in the common room is green. Harry Potter along with Ron Weasley entered the common room in his second year to find out if Draco Malfoy was the one opening the Chamber of Secrets. To enter the Slytherin common room one must merely speak aloud the current password in front of a stretch of a damp stone wall; once the word is uttered a concealed stone door will slide aside leaving a rectangular hole in the wall leading to the Slytherin common room. The only known Slytherin password is \"pureblood\", used in 1992.\\n\\n\\n==Head of House==\\nFounders slytherin.jpg|Salazar Slytherin(10th century)\\nHorace Slughorn.jpg|Horace Slughorn (1920s-1981; 1997-Pre 2016)\\nSeverus Snape.jpg|Severus Snape (1981-1996)\\nSlytherin\\'s head of house for Harry\\'s first six years of school was Severus Snape; however, as he fled with the Death Eaters in 1997 at the end of Harry\\'s sixth year, Potions Master Horace Slughorn became the head of Slytherin House. Upon Snape\\'s return as Headmaster later that year, he apparently approved of Slughorn\\'s appointment, as he did not assign any Death Eaters as the new head of house.\\n\\n\\n==Known Slytherins==\\nHot-tempered lord and squire who remorsefully committed suicide for inadvertently killing the woman he loved in a fit of rage when she refused to come home from Albania with him, leaving his clothes stained with her blood.

Now has a portrait at the base of the Grand Staircase between the Entrance Hall archway and First-floor corridor doorway, which was later hung near the Potions Classroom entrance and guarded the dungeons, telling Slytherins to be \\'\\'\"Nasty to Mudbloods\"\\'\\'.\\n*Slytherin students seem to possess a certain skill in Potions. Harry\\'s two Potions masters, Severus Snape and Horace Slughorn, both belonged to the Slytherin house. However, it is possible that this talent in Slytherin students could merely be a coincidence, as students from other houses at Hogwarts also shared this talent, such as Harry Potter\\'s mother, Lily Potter (nee Evans) (whose skills were shown through Slughorn\\'s many references to her skill in the subject throughout most of ), and Hermione Granger who were both Gryffindors, and Penny Haywood who was in Hufflepuff.\\n*Slytherin students also seem to be gifted in Occlumency. Most of the known Occlumens in the books come from Slytherin (namely Voldemort, Severus Snape, Bellatrix Lestrange, Draco Malfoy, and Horace Slughorn).\\n*J. K. Rowling stated in a PotterCast interview that some Slytherins were among the reinforcements brought by Slughorn during the Battle of Hogwarts.thumb\\n*J. K. Rowling stated that by 2017, Slytherin is no longer the pure-blood bastion that it once was. However, its dark reputation still lingers, hence the reason for Albus Potter\\'s fears.\\n*It is interesting to note that Slytherin is both the first Hogwarts house mentioned in the series (by Draco Malfoy), as well as the last mentioned in the series (by Albus Potter).\\n*In early drafts of , members of the Slytherin house were known as \"Slytherites\".\\n*Slytherin House was the winner of the first, third and seventh house cup on.\\n*The Sorting Hat considered placing Gilderoy Lockhart in Slytherin.

       " {'content': 'Ravenclaw is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Rowena Ravenclaw. Members of this house are characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom. The emblematic animal symbol is an eagle, and blue and bronze are its colours. The Head of Ravenclaw is Filius Flitwick and the house ghost is the Grey Lady, otherwise known as the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, Helena Ravenclaw.\\nRavenclaw corresponds roughly to the element of air, and it is for that reason that the House colours were chosen; blue and bronze represent the sky and eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do with air. The Ravenclaw points hourglass contains blue sapphires.\\n\\n\\n==Traits==\\nRowena Ravenclaw, the founder of Ravenclaw\\nRavenclaw House prizes learning, wisdom, wit, and intellect in its members. Thus, many Ravenclaws tend to be academically motivated and talented students. They also pride themselves on being original in their ideas, and methods. It\\'s not unusual to find Ravenclaw students practising especially different types of magic that other houses might shun. Hermione Granger, an extremely intelligent witch and the top student in her year, was sorted into Gryffindor, though she admitted that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered placing her in Ravenclaw.\\nOften hard-working and diligent, as often is the case with intellectuals with a predisposition for academics, some of the pupils sorted under the blue-bronzed eagle are known to be inclined to dismiss certain social expectations for the sake of satisfying their own intellectual curiosity. Some of these eventually also ended up being not only accepted but even celebrated, in spite of being initially subjected to scorn for their various oddities. Luna Lovegood, for example, was one such student: Eccentric to put it at its mildest, she was a Ravenclaw student who initially was bullied for her open defiance of conventionality, but ultimately became a celebrated wizarding naturalist and renowned for her participation in the legendary Battle of Hogwarts and past membership in Dumbledore\\'s Army. Another example would be Professor Filius Flitwick, a half-goblin who might have faced scorn for his short stature earlier in life but went on to become a renowned Duelling Champion, and subsequently one of the finest and most knowledgable Charms Masters in the entirety of the wizarding world during his employment at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. (\\'\\'The\\'\\' best, according to some of his students).\\nRavenclaws tend to be curious about the world and pay attention to the world around them. Ravenclaws are known to be logical and rational. In addition, Ravenclaw students tend to have abilities regarding Memory. Garrick Ollivander, for example,\\xa0possessed an eidetic memory and can remember every wand he has sold, and Gilderoy Lockhart had an exceptional talent in the Memory Charm.\\nEven so, not all Ravenclaws were motivated by academic prowess. Examples of such individuals included Gilderoy Lockhart and Cho Chang, both of whom sought to use the good name and renown of their house, the inherent expectations of certain academic prowess that comes with being sorted into it as well as the often somewhat natural ability of its members to gain popularity among their peers, which particularly was the case of the former, proving true the fact that a good student did not necessarily make a good witch or wizard.\\nMinerva McGonagall was a Hatstall, having approximately equal Ravenclaw and Gryffindor traits; the Sorting Hat finally Sorted her into Gryffindor. Hermione Granger was also considered for Ravenclaw due to her intelligence, but the hat ultimately decided on Gryffindor once again. Filius Flitwick was in the same situation at the time of his Sorting, but in his case the Hat decided on Ravenclaw instead of Gryffindor.\\n\\n\\n==Reputation==\\nAccording to Slytherin prefect Gemma Farley, Ravenclaws are so competitive when it comes to academic success that they are known to backstab each other, and likely other students, in order to get top marks. While Hufflepuff prefect Gabriel Truman noted that they are so proud of the success of famous members, such as Laverne de Montmorency, that they claim any intelligent wizard as a member of Ravenclaw House, such as Bridget Wenlock, who was, in fact, a Hufflepuff. Some Ravenclaws, such as\\xa0Uric the Oddball, Xenophilius Lovegood, and his daughter Luna Lovegood are also noted to have a propensity towards eccentricity.\\nRavenclaw House appears to have\\xa0little rivalry with the other houses, except in Quidditch. Harry Potter believed that they tended to side with Gryffindor in its rivalry with Slytherin, as did Hufflepuff house. However, during the 1994 Triwizard Tournament, most Ravenclaws supported Hufflepuff Champion Cedric Diggory over Harry.\\xa0They believed that Harry had, in fact, cheated his way into being a champion and that the true Hogwarts champion was Cedric. Many Ravenclaws (such as Cho Chang) joined Dumbledore\\'s Army and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts along with Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs. They rose at almost the exact moment as the Hufflepuffs and turned their wands upon Pansy Parkinson and Slytherin House in Harry Potter\\'s defence when the former wished to hand Harry over to Lord Voldemort and his army of Death Eaters.\\nWithin the house, though, they’re well-known for being welcoming and encouraging of creativity, eccentricity, and individuality and being very accepting.\\n\\n\\n==Common Room==\\nThe Ravenclaw common room is in one of the castle\\'s towers and is wide and circular. You have to climb a tight spiral staircase to get there. It has graceful arched windows, and the walls are hung with blue and bronze silks. The domed ceiling is painted with stars, which are echoed in the midnight-blue carpet. Tables, chairs, and bookcases cover the expanse of the floor, and a white marble statue of Rowena Ravenclaw sits next to the door that leads to the dormitories above. Harry Potter entered the common room in 1998 while searching for clues to the location of one of Voldemort\\'s Horcruxes.\\nUnlike the other common rooms in the school, a logical riddle given by a bronze eagle-shaped knocker must be answered to enter. This could prove troublesome as anyone with enough intellect could intrude into the dormitory, as is shown in 1998 where Professor McGonagall had no trouble entering by answering the riddle correctly (though she was a \"hatstall\" between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw). On the other hand, a particularly poorly-phrased riddle might bemuse a particular student, blocking them from entering and forcing them to sleep outside. However, Hermione stated in her first year when figuring out the complicated riddle, beneath the trapdoor, that most wizards and witches do not have much sense of logic, which might be something that Ravenclaw noticed herself and decided to use clever riddles instead of passwords, as they are safer than some words.\\n\\n\\n==Head of House==\\nFounders ravenclaw.jpg|Rowena Ravenclaw (10th century)\\nFilius Flitwick profile.jpg|Filius Flitwick\\n The head of\\xa0House before and during Harry Potter\\'s time was Filius Flitwick.
