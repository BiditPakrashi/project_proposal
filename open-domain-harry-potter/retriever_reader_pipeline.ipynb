       "  <Document: {'content': 'Professor Cuthbert Binns was a wizard and History of Magic professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He owned an office in the main castle and Classroom 4F on the first floor to teach in. He taught until a very old age, when he fell asleep in the staff room and died in slumber. Afterwards, he became a ghost who continued to teach, droning on about various Goblin Rebellions and Giant Wars to bored, sleeping students.\\nProfessor Binns\\'s lessons were regarded as some of the most boring at Hogwarts, and only once in known history did he talk about something not strictly factual. During the 1991–1992 school year, he taught his first year students about numerous historical personalities such as Uric the Oddball and Emeric the Evil, whom the class always got confused with. The following academic year, he relayed the legend of the Chamber of Secrets to his second year class, but only after every student in the class showed complete and utter interest, despite initially stating the legend of the Chamber to be unimportant. He continued to teach Harry Potter and his class for three further years, until most, if not every one of his students dropped History of Magic after completing their Ordinary Wizarding Levels.\\n\\n\\n===Early life===\\nCuthbert was born into the Binns family, with Mr Binns as his father. It was said that his father always used to say something to him, but Cuthbert fell asleep in the middle of his sentence before he could say what it was.\\n\\n\\n====Earlier years====\\nCuthbert came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and applied for the post of Professor of History of Magic, which he was granted. Cuthbert - now known as Professor Binns - was given Classroom 4F on the first floor near a mossy courtyard to teach in, as well as an office in the fifth-floor corridor.\\nHis lessons were known to be the most boring in all of Hogwarts; he read from his never-ending collection of notes. His students, whom he never payed any attention to, would fall asleep listening to his droning, reedy voice, eventually waking up to copy down a name or date, but falling asleep again.\\n\\n\\n====Later years and death====\\nProfessor Binns was still teaching well into his elderly years at Hogwarts, still lecturing students on History of Magic. Now so old that he looked like a wrinkled tortoise, Binns went down to the staffroom on the ground floor and went to sleep in front of the fire. However, he died in his sleep and, when he got up to teach his next class, was a ghost. Regardless, he did not seem to notice, though he did begin to fly into his classroom through the blackboard, but his lessons were still just as boring as ever. It was said the most exciting thing that happened in his class was when he entered through the blackboard.\\n\\n\\n====1970s====\\nDuring the 1970s, Professor Binns taught James Potter, Lily Evans, Peter Pettigrew, Remus Lupin and Sirius Black. For unknown reasons, Binns gave one of his Chocolate Frog Cards, that of Circe, to James Potter, which later fell into the hands of Quirinus Quirrell who put it into his vault, number 998.\\n\\n\\n====1988–1989 school year====\\nIn the 1988–1989 school year, one of the groups Binns taught had 16 fifth year students which included Jacob\\'s sibling, Nymphadora Tonks and Charlie Weasley. As always, these classes were seen as boring by most students. Sometimes Tonks used her Metamorphmagus ability to transform into Binns in order to make lessons more interesting. Most of the time, Binns did not pay attention to the class, leading to students doing activities such as tasting candy or playing Exploding Snap.\\nWhen preparing to enter the Portrait Vault, Jacob\\'s sibling went to Binns along with Bill Weasley and Merula Snyde in order to learn about dragons. Later, the three, along with Patricia Rakepick, Ben Copper and either Charlie Weasley or Penny Haywood went to Binns to learn about Portkeys.\\n\\n\\n====1991–1992 school year====\\nDuring the 1991–1992 school year, Professor Binns gained the famous Harry Potter as a student. However, Binns did not notice his legendary pupil, since he did not pay any attention to his class as he read through his notes, expecting them to copy down bullet points. That year, Binns taught his first years about historical figures such as Uric the Oddball and Emeric the Evil, whom his students always got confused with. Harry also said that he considered History of Magic to be \"\\'\\'easily the most boring lesson\\'\\'\" in the school. However, Binns also gained a gifted student, Hermione Granger, who alone seems to be immune to the soporific effects of his lectures, as she listened and took notes seriously.\\n\\n\\n====1992–1993 school year====\\nBinns tells his students the story of the Chamber of Secrets\\nThe following year, the Chamber of Secrets was reopened and Mrs Norris, Argus Filch (the Caretaker\\'s) cat, was petrified by Salazar Slytherin\\'s Basilisk. Regardless, the school ran as normal and one of Professor Binns\\'s homework he gave out just after the attack was a three-foot essay on The Medieval Assembly of European Wizards. While lecturing his second years on the International Warlocks\\' Convention of 1289, Hermione Granger raised her hand and asked about the legend of the Chamber. Despite initially refusing to grant her wish, he relayed the legend after seeing the unusual amount of interest and attention his class were giving him. After reciting the story, each of his pupils argued against his belief that there was no Chamber, but he put a stop to them and their theories and, within five minutes, had bored them to sleep with his lecture. Later on in the year, he was visited by the Deputy Headmistress, Minerva McGonagall, who told him that Harry Potter and Ron Weasley would be absent from his History of Magic class due to their visit to the petrified Hermione Granger.\\n\\n\\n====1993–1994 school year====\\nDuring the 1993–1994 school year, Professor Binns continued to teach Harry Potter and his classmates. One night in the winter term, Binns allowed Professor Remus Lupin, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, to teach Harry how to cast the Patronus Charm in the History of Magic Classroom.\\n\\n\\n====1994–1995 school year====\\nThe following academic year, Professor Binns gave his fourth years a huge workload of writing an entire composition every week, in preparation for their Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations in their next year. Since Harry Potter had been chosen as a champion for the Triwizard Tournament, he was exempt from the End-of-Term Exams, and so, paid less attention to Binns than usual and spent the time looking up fresh hexes for the Triwizard Tasks. It was known that one History of Magic lesson was two classes before the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament, followed by Transfiguration with Minerva McGonagall. Also, the History of Magic Fourth year exams were on the day of the Third and Final Task of the Tournament.\\n\\n\\n====1995–1996 school year====\\nDolores Umbridge, Hogwarts High Inquisitor\\nFor one of his first classes of the 1995–1996 school year, known to be a Monday, Professor Binns lectured his fifth year students on wars caused and participated in by Giants, which would have been interesting had it been taught by a more engaging teacher. After an hour of lecturing, Binns left the classroom through the blackboard. He had another History of Magic class the following Monday, just after Dolores Umbridge\\'s appointment as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, which was noted to be just as boring, drowsy and depressing as the last. That year was the year of his students\\' Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations, and he made his students write down notes for them to revise from for their exams. It was unknown if Umbridge inspected Binns\\'s classes that year, as she was not present during Harry\\'s lectures.\\n\\n\\n====1997–1998 school year====\\nDuring the 1997–1998 school year, Voldemort had seized control over Hogwarts. It was unknown how this affected Professor Binns or if he took any part in the Battle of Hogwarts against the Death Eaters.\\n\\n\\n====After the War ====\\nIt is likely that Professor Binns continued his long tenure as Professor of History of Magic after the war.\\n\\n\\n==Physical description==\\nProfessor Binns, as being a ghost, was described as looking ancient and shrivelled, and looked a little like an old tortoise when he pursed his lips. He wore glasses, which were small and thick, and had a dry, reedy voice that sounded a lot like an old vacuum cleaner, droning on and on.\\n\\n\\n==Personality and traits==\\nProfessor Binns did not display much of a personality, as all he did was read his notes in a droning voice to his students, while oblivious or disinterested about how everyone simply dozed off from boredom. However, it can be seen that he was very impatient and did not take the liberty of learning his students\\' names, calling Hermione Granger \"Miss Grant\", Parvati Patil \"Miss Pennyfeather\", Seamus Finnigan \"O\\'Flaherty\" and even the famous Harry Potter \"Perkins\". It\\'s possible he was actually calling them by the names of previous students from years ago, possibly due to senility as he was very old at the time of death. Binns was also shown to be a firm disbeliever in legends and mythology, dedicating his studies and lectures on \"\\'\\'solid, believable \\'\\'fact\". He is said to have a drawling monotonous voice, which most of his students become quickly bored with.\\n\\n\\n==Magical abilities and skills==\\n*History of Magic: Being the Professor of History of Magic at Hogwarts, he was an authority in and thoroughly knowledgeable of magical history, teaching the subject for several decades at Hogwarts School, with his rich and varied historical knowledge spanning much of wizarding history.\\n*Magizoology: Binns was shown to be knowledgeable in the study of magical creatures, as he had knowledge about the traits of several different breeds of dragons.\\n*Teaching skills: Binns must have proven himself to have been an adequate teacher to have acquired his position at Hogwarts as a Professor whilst he was alive. However, his teaching after his death had proven to be ineffective, as he simply read notes in a droning manner that lulled many students to fall asleep. His unenthusiastic manner of communications, lack of interest in his students\\' attention, and his refusal to delve into what he considered to be myth, greatly hampered his skills in delivering information to his class and keeping them interested in his subject.\\n\\n\\n==Possessions==\\n*Office: While teaching at Hogwarts, Binns had an office on the fifth floor.\\n*Books: Binns owned several books, including a Draconifors spellbook, Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century, and several other books.\\n\\n\\n==Etymology==\\n*\"Binns\" is from \"binoculars\", a slang term for spectacles. Notice that Professor Binns wore very thick glasses.\\n*A bin is a large storage container. A dustbin is British English for a garbage can. This boring professor could be described as a ghostly storage for information that many Hogwarts students view as rubbish.\\n\\n\\n==Behind the scenes==\\n*Professor Binns does assign homework and essays, though as he is a ghost it\\'s unknown how he is able to mark them. Given this, it is possible he has a student assistant, like the ones in Music and Muggle Studies. Alternatively, he might be in possession of a quill that he can tell what to write and therefore does not need to actually touch it to grade papers.\\n*Binns has not appeared in any of the films nor the PC games. His explanation in  of the legend of the Chamber of Secrets is instead given by Professor McGonagall in the film and Professor Flitwick in the PC game.\\n*In the videogame \\'\\'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\'\\', there is one History of Magic classroom featured on the Fourth Floor corridor. Professor Binns, however, is never seen in the game.\\n*The only video games Professor Binns has made an appearance (so far) are the Game Boy Color adaptations,  and , although he was mentioned in the \\'\\'Order of the Phoenix\\'\\' video game. On the Game Boy Color versions Binns has a tendency to fall asleep during lectures and to forget about things.\\n*Professor Binns\\' first name only appeared on a list of the Hogwarts professors which was released on .\\n*Professor Binns is seen in the book series as a stereotyped old man; he forgets things seconds after hearing them, has a slow droning voice, and gets irritable at times.\\n*As Binns became a ghost, he can no longer move beyond the veil, and will remain earthbound for all eternity. This means that unless he resigns or is sacked, he would be the History of Magic teacher forever.\\n*Since Binns died in the staffroom, and continued on as if nothing happened, it can be assumed that he feared death (or what lies beyond the veil). Perhaps teaching was what Binns wanted to do, for literally all eternity.\\n*In \"Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey\" ride in Orlando Florida, Dumbledore mentions that Professor Binns will be giving the audience a lecture entitled \\'\\'Hogwarts Through the Centuries\\'\\' and that it will be \"...long\". Harry, Ron and Hermione sneak the audience out of the Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom before Professor Binns shows up.\\n*In , Binns states, \"\\'\\'There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard!\\'\\'\" Ironically enough, there \\'\\'is\\'\\' a secret broom cupboard in Hogwarts: the Weasley twins told Harry that when they were running away from Filch once, they took refuge in a broom cupboard, which was later revealed to be the Room of Requirement.\\n*According to the Prisoner of Azkaban transcript on thepensieve.org, Professor Binns makes an appearance in the film, as a ghost who reports to Dumbledore shortly after \"The Flight of the Fat Lady.\" However, if this is true, none of Binns\\' more memorable traits are portrayed in the films.\\n*Binns\\' recollection of his father strongly suggests that not only did he pick up his droning style of speech from him, but that like his own students, it put Binns himself to sleep from boredom.\\n\\n\\n===Author\\'s comments===\\n\"\\'\\'The most productive ghost at Hogwarts is, of course,\\xa0Professor Binns, the old History of Magic teacher who fell asleep in front of the staff-room fire one day and simply got up to give his next class, leaving his body behind. There is some debate as to whether or not Professor Binns realises he is dead. While his entrance to lessons through the blackboard is vaguely amusing the first time students see it, he is not the most stimulating teacher.\\'\\'\\n\\'\\'The inspiration for Professor Binns was an old professor at my university, who gave every lecture with his eyes closed, rocking backwards and forwards slightly on his toes. While he was a brilliant man, who disgorged an immense amount of valuable information at every lecture, his disconnect with his students was total. Professor Binns is only dimly aware of his living students, and is astonished when they begin asking him questions.\\'\\'\"', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.7779872589446785, 'meta': {'url': 'https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Cuthbert_Binns', 'name': 'Cuthbert_Binns'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '3e32561f8b2f0dbcb16860c0cd8c6cf6'}>,\n",

It was his favourite by far. One year old and already zooming along on a toy broomstick, he looked so pleased with himself, I'm enclosing a picture so you can see. You know it only rises about two feet off the ground, but he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent me for Christmas (no complaints there). Of course, James thought it was funny, says he's going to be a great Quidditch player, but we've had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we don't take our eyes off him when he gets going.''\\n:''We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who has always been sweet to us, and who dotes on Harry. We were so sorry you couldn't come, but the Order's got to come first, and Harry's not old enough to know it's his birthday anyway! James is getting a bit frustrated shut up here, he tries not to show it but I can tell -- also, Dumbledore's still got his Invisibility Cloak, so no chance of little excursions.

The second page of the letter was missing, leaving the last portion of the letter to be cut off. There was also a picture of Harry riding on a toy broomstick found with the letter, although the picture had been torn in half with one part missing, with only James and Harry in it. \\nHarry searched the room for the last part of the letter, but was unable to find it. He kept the letter and photograph in his mokeskin pouch over the next several months while he, Ron, and Hermione continued on their mission to destroy Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes. The end of the letter was discovered in a memory of Severus Snape's that was extracted by Harry just before Snape's death during the Battle of Hogwarts on 2 May, 1998.

But there are two possible explanations.\\n**Remus Lupin got ahold of the letter after Sirius was arrested and returned it to him after his escape.\\n**After Sirius was arrested, his personal belongings, including the letter, were turned over to his mother Walburga Black, who was still alive at the time and living in 12 Grimmauld place, since she was his nearest next-of-kind.\\n\\n\\n==Notes and references==\\nde2:Lily J.

When his parents died, he was adopted by Isolt Sayre and James Steward and was living at Ilvermorny. For his eleventh birthday, he had requested a wand. Isolt and James crafted a wand for him similar to the wand of his elder brother, Chadwick.\\nWebster was given his wand two years after his brother. While Chadwick's wand was made of prickly ash, the exact wood used to construct Webster's wand is unknown. However, they were both given wands with Horned Serpent horn as the core material. Isolt had a dream the evening before Chadwick's eleventh birthday, where she went down to the creek to find the Horned Serpent come up to her from the water and bow its head to her, and let her take a shard of its horn. When Isolt woke, she went down to the creek where the Horned Serpent was waiting for her, and as in her dream, received shards of its horn. She then took it to James, who was a skilled craftsman, and they created Chadwick's wand. They later did the same for Webster.\\nIsolt had a protective instinct not to make any more wands of Horned Serpent horn other than for her adoptive sons. The wand proved to be adept for duelling, as evidenced by Webster's duel with Gormlaith Gaunt five years later. Gormlaith did not know Webster and his brother were living at Ilvermorny, so they were not sent into an enchanted slumber by her spell; because their wands were made with the horn of the great river serpent, they were not made inactive when she spoke Parseltongue. The wands instead recognised the language, and made the sound of a low musical note to warn its owner. The sound woke Chadwick and Webster, who then went to duel Gormlaith.\\nWhen Webster helped Chadwick, the twin cores of their wands increased their exceptional power. However, Gormlaith matched their power with her extensive knowledge of Dark magic, eventually forcing the brothers to retreat back into Ilvermorny.\\nIt is unknown what happened to the wand after Webster's death.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.8471386240667855, 'meta': {'url': \"https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Webster_Boot's_wand\", 'name': 'Webster_Boot_s_wand'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd6dedb8cb9893d0d0955750657253c36'}>],\n",

During the opening banquet at the beginning of each school year, the first-year students are lined up and their names read aloud alphabetically. Each then takes a seat on a stool and the hat is placed on his or her head. \\nThe hat is battered and old; it\\'s patched, frayed, and extremely dirty. In order to speak and sing, a tear along the brim opens like a mouth. It speaks to the wearer inside of the hat with a small, quiet voice, using Legilimency to interpret their thoughts and respond to them. After a time of consideration, the hat announces its choice aloud for all to hear, and the student joins the selected house. The moment of consideration varies in time period from less than a second to over five minutes (known as \"hatstall\").\\nThe Sorting Hat is notorious for refusing to admit it has made a mistake in its sorting of a student.

This is further enhanced by the fact that Isolt felt she would have been a Ravenclaw had she been able to attend Hogwarts. However, J. K.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'A common room is a shared lounge area in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There is one for each house. The common rooms feature fireplaces and sitting areas and are decorated in house colours. They are often used to do homework and to socialise with housemates. The boys\\' and girls\\' dormitories are also attached to the common rooms, with spells in place to prevent male students from entering the girls\\' dorms, but not vice versa, which Ronald Weasley felt was unfair.\\nThe four houses each have a protective measure to prevent students from other houses entering. To enter the Gryffindor Tower and the Slytherin Dungeon, one requires a password. The Ravenclaw Tower requires the answer to a riddle in order to enter, and the Hufflepuff Basement requires tapping the barrel \\'two from the bottom, middle of the second row\\' in the stack of barrels near the kitchen corridor, in the rhythm of Helga Hufflepuff.\\nIt can be said that the methods of gaining entry to each house\\'s common room mirrors the perceived intellectual reputation of each house. Hufflepuff, often known as the house with no certain particular aptitude in its students, has a very simple method of entry that never changes. On the other end of the spectrum, Ravenclaw, a house prizing intelligence, provides a new intellectual challenge with each attempted entry.\\nIt was against Hogwarts covenants for parents or professors to enter common areas without specific permission, most likely from the Headmaster.\\n\\n\\n==Common rooms==\\n*Gryffindor Common Room  — located in Gryffindor Tower, through the Fat Lady\\'s portrait.\\n*Hufflepuff Common Room — located in Hufflepuff Basement, below ground level behind a stack of barrels near the kitchens.\\n*Ravenclaw Common Room — located in Ravenclaw Tower, beyond a bronze eagle-shaped knocker that poses a riddle.\\n*Slytherin Common Room — located in Slytherin Dungeon, below ground level beyond a stone wall.\\n\\n\\n==Behind the scenes==\\n*Hufflepuff is the only house to have a defence mechanism for the common room. If someone taps the wrong barrel or the wrong rhythm, they are doused in vinegar.\\n*The location of common rooms other than one\\'s own is generally secret to Hogwarts students. Harry Potter learned of the location of two common rooms other than Gryffindor\\'s only through extraordinary circumstances-- the usage of Polyjuice Potion to transform into Gregory Goyle in his second year to follow Draco Malfoy to the Slytherin common room and by consent of Luna Lovegood to the Ravenclaw common room to observe a model of Rowena Ravenclaw\\'s diadem just before the Battle of Hogwarts. When Harry, Ron and Hermione were snatched by Fenrir Greyback\\'s Snatcher gang, Harry replied \"Slytherin\" when asked what House he was in at Hogwarts. Scabior stated that it was funny how everyone thought that was what they wanted to hear, but nobody they had snatched could tell them where Slytherin\\'s common room was.

They may serve concurrently as Deputy Headmaster but not as Headmaster.\\n\\n\\n==Selection==\\nProvided they were in the House while a student at Hogwarts, teachers at Hogwarts may apply for the role. They are most likely selected by the Head of the school.\\nSeverus Snape was made Head of Slytherin at the remarkably young age of twenty-one, when he only just returned to Hogwarts. It may be that he was the only teacher who was in Slytherin, following the retirement of Horace Slughorn in 1981. When Slughorn returned in 1996, Snape jealously guarded the prerogatives of the Headship, suggesting the teacher may not have to retire to lose the role.\\n\\n\\n==Duties==\\nA Head of House is charged with monitoring and maintaining the welfare, safety, and discipline of all members of their designated house, as well as corresponding with the parents of said students whenever necessary. They need to be nearby for emergency situations, such as when they informed students of new safety measures in\\xa01993. It is unlikely that they can be far from the Hogwarts/Hogsmeade area for too long, except during holidays. They probably reside at Hogwarts throughout the school year. However, Minerva McGonagall owned a cottage in nearby Hogsmeade during her marriage to Elphinstone Urquart in the 1980s. Although they can travel to Hogwarts when they live nearby, the school is very protected, which means Apparition, the Floo Network, or a Portkey would not be easy.\\nWhen they decide to live in Hogwarts, they will most likely will have private quarters near their House's common room. On at least one occasion, Professor McGonagall heard the noise of a party in the Gryffindor Tower from wherever she was sleeping. This may be the reason why Severus Snape did not take an office closer to his Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom in 1996, despite no longer teaching Potions.\\nWhile any professor can give a student detention or take points from any House, they speak to the Head of House when the student is in more than a little trouble. Professor McGonagall once told Draco Malfoy that she would see Professor Snape about him, after catching him out of bed at night.\\nThe Head of House collects signed permission forms from their House's third year students, verifying that the students have permission to visit Hogsmeade on certain weekends. They also hold career counselling meetings with fifth year\\xa0students, advising them on what N.E.W.T.-level classes they should take in preparation for their desired careers.\\nAt the beginning of the sixth year for students, the Head of House will sit with each student and look at what subjects they want to take and whether they have obtained the O.W.L. grade they needed to continue. They will advise them on what to do when they haven't.\\nWhen the weekend Apparition Course takes place at the school, the Heads of House attend and help oversee the participating students from their House.\\nThey may be used as a personal reference whenever one of their former students seeks employment.\\nAs every Head of House attended Hogwarts in the house they lead, they often encourage their team to win at events.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'The Sorting Hat is a sentient hat at Hogwarts that magically determines which of the four school Houses each new student belongs most to. These four Houses are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. The Sorting Hat originally belonged to Godric Gryffindor, one of the four founders of Hogwarts. It normally stays in the Headmaster\\'s office until it is needed.\\n\\n\\n==Overview==\\nThe famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat gives an account of its own genesis in a series of songs. During the opening banquet at the beginning of each school year, the first-year students are lined up and their names read aloud alphabetically. Each then takes a seat on a stool and the hat is placed on his or her head. \\nThe hat is battered and old; it\\'s patched, frayed, and extremely dirty. In order to speak and sing, a tear along the brim opens like a mouth. It speaks to the wearer inside of the hat with a small, quiet voice, using Legilimency to interpret their thoughts and respond to them. After a time of consideration, the hat announces its choice aloud for all to hear, and the student joins the selected house. The moment of consideration varies in time period from less than a second to over five minutes (known as \"hatstall\").\\nThe Sorting Hat is notorious for refusing to admit it has made a mistake in its sorting of a student. On those occasions when Slytherins behave altruistically or selflessly, when Ravenclaws flunk all their exams, when Hufflepuffs prove lazy yet academically gifted, and when Gryffindors exhibit cowardice, the Hat steadfastly backs its original decision. On balance, however, the Hat has made remarkably few errors of judgement over the many centuries it has been at work.\\n\\n\\n==History==\\nThe Sorting Hat, Sorting students into their respective houses at the ceremony\\nLegend has it that the Sorting Hat was sewn roughly one thousand years ago and began as a normal hat belonging to Godric Gryffindor. When Gryffindor, along with Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff, wondered how they would continue to sort the students when the four were dead, Gryffindor pulled his hat from his head and, along with the other founders, enchanted it with their combined intelligence. All four founders wanted to ensure that students would be sorted into their eponymous houses, which would be selected according to each founder\\'s particular preferences in students.\\nThe Sorting Hat on a shelf in the Headmaster\\'s office\\nThe Sorting Hat, now animated, was able to sort and divide the students into the Hogwarts Houses, and continued to do so for a millennium, passed down to each new Headmaster or Headmistress of the school. When not in use, it is placed on a shelf in the current Headmaster\\'s or Headmistress\\'s office. \\nThe hat continues to carry out its duty each September at the beginning of the start-of-term feast, when it is placed on a three-legged (sometimes four-legged) stool at the front of the Great Hall.\\nIn 1858, Angus Buchanan, an eleven-year old Scottish Squib managed to sneak into the feast with the help of his wizard brother and put the Sorting Hat on his head. The Sorting Hat then kindly said he was a good-hearted chap but no wizard.\\nGodric Gryffindor\\'s Sword, one of the founder\\'s only other known relics, can be magically pulled out of the hat by any Gryffindor considered worthy, no matter how secure the sword\\'s location. It is unknown why this is possible, but is linked to loyalty of the highest regard in relation to Hogwarts. There are two known instances of this happening within the seven years of Harry\\'s adventures, once when Harry was in the Chamber of Secrets, and once when Neville refused to join Voldemort during the Battle of Hogwarts.\\n\\n\\n==The Sorting Hat\\'s songs==\\nBefore sorting the students each year, the hat recites a new introductory song. These songs vary in length and content though they generally introduce the hat and its role in sorting new students. Ron Weasley expressed the opinion that the Hat spends the entire school year making up its next song.\\nThey also occasionally warn of danger to come, as in its 1995 song, though it is not known how the Hat is aware of upcoming events. It was suggested that the Hat picks up some of its information from Albus Dumbledore, though it is not known whether it would have done so before such an influential figure in the wider wizarding world was in office.\\n\\n\\n===Early 2000s Song===\\nYou may call me worn and ragged\\nBut listen close and I will tell\\nI\\'ll find right where you belong\\n\\n\\n===2017 Song===\\nI\\'ve done this job for centuries\\nOn every student\\'s head I\\'ve sat\\nFor I\\'m the famous Sorting Hat.\\nI\\'ve sorted high, I\\'ve sorted low,\\nI\\'ve done the job through thick and thin\\nWhich house you should be in...\\n\\n\\n===2019 Song===\\nAre you afraid of what you\\'ll hear?\\nAfraid I\\'ll speak the name you fear?\\nDon\\'t worry, child, I know my job,\\nYou\\'ll learn to laugh, if first you sob.\\n\\n\\n===Harry Potter===\\nThe Sorting Hat appeared to have a difficult time in the sorting of Harry Potter. It suggested that Harry would have great fame and glory by joining Slytherin House. As Harry possessed Slytherin qualities such as, cunning and determination. Harry requested specifically to be spared that fate. Instead, based upon this choice, the Hat placed him in Gryffindor, where both his parents had also been Sorted. When Harry spoke to the Hat in his second year, it repeated its earlier declarations - that Harry would have done well in Slytherin. This is thought to be due to the fragment of Voldemort\\'s soul which lived inside Harry during his sorting; the hat would have registered its presence, as well, noticing Harry\\'s potential.\\nIn the next year at Hogwarts, the Hat also played a critical role in Harry\\'s success against the Basilisk. Fawkes had brought the Sorting Hat to Harry\\'s aid in the Chamber of Secrets. This provided him with Godric Gryffindor\\'s Sword, which Harry used to slay Slytherin\\'s Basilisk. The sword and hat together are the only two known relics of that wizard.\\nAlmost two decades after the Battle of Hogwarts, Albus Severus Potter expressed worry over his own Sorting. He indicated that the Sorting Hat might put him in the Slytherin House, and that its judgement may be faulty after being repaired. However, as the hat is said to be old and patched from its first appearance, it would seem this worry is needless. Harry also reassured him that Albus\\' middle name was named after Severus Snape, a Slytherin head master, and Harry would had no hard feelings towards Albus, Slytherin House or the Hat if he was to be sorted to there.\\n\\n\\n===Hermione Granger===\\nThe Sorting Hat also appeared to have had a disagreement in the sorting of Hermione Granger, as her expansive intelligence made her well suited for Ravenclaw, but it decided to place her in Gryffindor. However, it can be argued that Hermione saw a greater challenge in herself in becoming bold and courageous, some of the traits of Gryffindor House. This can be clearly seen when Hermione doubted books and cleverness as the traits of a great witch and instead shows that friendship and bravery are more important. Hermione also stated that she thought Gryffindor House was by far the best of the four.\\n\\n\\n===Ron Weasley===\\nIt was not hard for the Sorting Hat to place Ron Weasley, as all the Weasley family have been placed into Gryffindor House. Ron was afraid that he would be the only Weasley not to make it into Gryffindor. Mere moments after the Hat touched his head it announced his house. A year later his little sister Ginny was also sorted into Gryffindor.\\n\\n\\n===Draco Malfoy===\\nThe moment the Sorting Hat was placed on Draco Malfoy, the hat instantaneously declared Draco would join the house of Slytherin. In addition to being selfish and cunning, Malfoy is a pure-blood, like most Slytherins. Almost all of his family was sorted into that house, including his parents Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange, as well as a long line of his ancestors from the House of Black.\\n\\n\\n===Tom Riddle===\\nAccording to Albus Dumbledore, the Sorting Hat declared Tom Riddle a Slytherin almost instantly after it touched his head. He had many of the qualities associated with the Slytherin house, and he was the last surviving descendant of Salazar Slytherin.\\n\\n\\n===Neville Longbottom===\\nThe Sorting Hat took a long time to decide upon where to put Neville Longbottom. During his sorting Neville argued with the hat, saying he was best in Hufflepuff. The Hat argued otherwise, and declared Neville to do greatly in Gryffindor. Neville was intimidated by Gryffindor\\'s reputation, however his persistence did not work and the hat successfully sorted him into Gryffindor. Considering the bravery Neville showed in his seventh year, and standing up to Draco, Harry, Ron, and Hermione in his first year, this choice is not regretted.\\nIn addition, during the Battle of Hogwarts, Neville was able to draw Gryffindor\\'s sword from the Hat (if done so, the person was considered a true Gryffindor), despite Voldemort attempting to destroy it and then used it to behead the snake Nagini.\\n\\n\\n===Minerva McGonagall===\\nMinerva McGonagall was what is considered a Hatstall, meaning the Sorting Hat took over five minutes to decide where to put her. Hatstalls are very rare. The Sorting Hat considered sorting Minerva McGonagall into Ravenclaw before choosing Gryffindor. Later, she became a teacher at Hogwarts and head of her old house. It is her job to place the Sorting Hat on the heads of new students.\\n\\n\\n===Filius Flitwick===\\nThe Sorting Hat considered Sorting Filius Flitwick into Gryffindor before choosing Ravenclaw. Later, he became a teacher at Hogwarts and head of his house, and joked with Minerva McGonagall about the fact that they had the opposite experiences and if things had gone another way, they could have had each others\\' jobs.\\n\\n\\n===Gilderoy Lockhart===\\nThe Sorting Hat considered Sorting Gilderoy Lockhart in Slytherin, but, in the end, decided to place him in Ravenclaw.\\n\\n\\n===Peter Pettigrew===\\nThe Sorting Hat needed more than five minutes to decide if Peter Pettigrew should be Sorted into Slytherin or Gryffindor. He was, thus, a true Hatstall. It chose Gryffindor. This decision was considered a mistake by many, though the Sorting Hat itself never considered it a mistake afterwards.\\n\\n\\n==Personality and traits==\\nThough it is a hat, the Sorting Hat is sentient and has its own personality. At the beginning of every term, the hat sings a new song (which Ron Weasley speculated it spent the rest of the year thinking up) describing each of the four houses of Hogwarts. Despite its use in the purposes of \"sorting,\" the Hat has been known to urge students to maintain a united front in the face of adversity and danger. Its songs can be used in warning of troubles to come, and ultimately the hat represents the unity of the four houses under the Hogwarts school.\\nThe hat also appears to have a sense of humour and expansive memory (as in the cases of the Weasleys all being in Gryffindor, and the Malfoys all being in Slytherin).\\n\\n\\n==Author\\'s comments==\\n*In an interview, when asked about the Sorting Hat, J. K. Rowling stated that it had never been wrong and asked for theories, though no specific character was mentioned. In exclusive content released for , however, she was a bit more shrewd, stating that it \"has made remarkably few errors of judgement over the many centuries it has been at work.\" She also stated that in those cases where students did not exhibit the qualities traditionally associated with their house, or were noted for those associated with others, \"the Hat steadfastly backs its original decision.\"\\n*According to Rowling, Sorting Hat wasn\\'t her first idea of how new Hogwarts student shall be sorted into Houses. She wrote:\\n\\n\\n==Behind the scenes==\\n*It seems that the Sorting Hat tends to place students based on qualities they value rather than qualities they personify. This is never more apparent than with Peter Pettigrew, who was Sorted into Gryffindor but ultimately turned out to be quite cowardly, self-serving and corruptible. He was probably placed there because at the time, he admired strong, brave individuals like James Potter and Sirius Black. Though it is possible Pettigrew was placed in Gryffindor because he aspired to these qualities.\\n*The Sorting Hat can detect nascent qualities in a student and place them in the House that will challenge them the most and put their character to the test. Case in point, Neville Longbottom is Sorted into Gryffindor because the Hat sensed that he was capable of demonstrating bravery and leadership during his time at Hogwarts. However, these qualities do not fully surface until he learns to believe in himself. He also places Hermione Granger in the same House, presumably because he realises just how much she will need Harry and Ron in the future.\\n*The Hat also appeared to take each student\\'s wishes into account. Just because someone is placed in a certain House does not mean that they can not possess characteristics of other Houses. Dumbledore claimed that choices can show just as much, if not more, about who someone is as their abilities.\\xa0Harry Potter, for instance, embodies many of the traits that are appreciated by Salazar Slytherin. He is clever, resourceful and cunning, yet the Sorting Hat made him a Gryffindor because he didn\\'t feel like he belonged there. However, the hat denied Neville from being in Hufflepuff even though he begged for it.\\n*Another prime example of this happening is Severus Snape. At one point, Albus Dumbledore said that his loyal, courageous nature was much more befitted to Gryffindor. However, as a child, Snape\\'s ambition, social-climbing behaviour and secret inclination towards sadism made him an obvious Slytherin when he first came to Hogwarts.\\n*In , the Sorting Hat appears to speak so all the students can hear, whereas in the book the Sorting Hat speaks so only the wearer can hear.\\n*In the first two and final Harry Potter films, it is voiced by actor Leslie Phillips.\\n*Songs are only featured in books 1, 4, and 5, and are omitted entirely from the films. This is because the books are exclusively from Harry\\'s point of view. In Book 2, he was preoccupied with the Whomping Willow, in Book 3, with Dementors, in Book 6, with Draco Malfoy\\'s antics, and in Book 7, with Horcruxes.\\n*Harry was not physically present for the Sorting Hat\\'s songs in books two, three, six and seven. Harry was, however, present for the song and Sorting ceremony in the third movie.\\n*According to Rowling, the hat detected the piece of Voldemort\\'s soul in Harry which strongly tempted it to put Harry in Slytherin.\\n*In \\'\\'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone\\'\\', Harry saw that \"there were only three people left to be sorted,\" but then Professor McGonagall read off four more names (Dean Thomas, Lisa Turpin, Ron Weasley and Blaise Zabini). Dean Thomas did not appear in the British edition. It is possible, however, that Harry did not see one of the first-years ahead of him.\\n*The Sorting Hat bears a certain resemblance to The  Archchancellor\\'s Hat from Terry Pratchett\\'s Discworld novel \\'.\\n*It is possible that the Sorting Hat, or general nature of the sorting, is not generally mentioned in books of wizarding history for some reason. In \\'\\'Harry Potter and the Philosopher\\'s Stone\\'\\', when the students are nervous about what sort of test they will face to be sorted, Hermione Granger is said to be whispering very fast about all the spells she\\'d learned and which one she would need. This is despite having read a number of books about wizarding history prior to entering the school.\\n*A LEGO version of the Sorting Hat was released, entitled 4701 Sorting Hat. It featured a dial with the four house symbols on it that could be spun to land on one and sort the figures.\\n*One of the possible choices on the W.O.M.B.A.T. aptitude test was that the hat was stolen and substituted by delinquent students in 1325, and the whereabouts of the real hat remain unknown.\\n*One can purchase a copy of the Sorting Hat at .\\n*Prior to creating the Sorting Hat, Rowling considered using a Magical Gateway, founder statues, a Ghost Court, or a Selection Committee. \\n**However, the idea of the founder statues was recycled into the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry sorting. \\n*Just before the  ride at , the Sorting Hat makes an appearance and delivers a final safety spiel, in the manner of one of his Sorting songs:\\n::\\'\\'\"Your journey is about to start, but safely you must go,\\'\\'\\n::\\'\\'And so the Hogwarts Sorting Hat tells all you need to know.\\'\\'\\n::\\'\\'These benches are not safe for you if you are still too small.\\'\\'\\n::\\'\\'You must be more than goblin-sized, 48 inches tall.\\'\\'\\n::\\'\\'Now rid yourself of objects that might poke or scratch or fall.\\'\\'\\n::\\'\\'Take jewellery, cell phones, all loose change and stow them, one and all.\\'\\'\\n::\\'\\'To keep your treasures safe and sound, Smart Lockers are supplied.\\'\\'\\n::\\'\\'Gringotts-made and wizard-proofed, for all you need to hide.\\'\\'\\n::\\'\\'And now, a warning; do not ride if flying makes you queasy.\\'\\'\\n::\\'\\'If pregnant or else sore in back or neck, then leave, it\\'s easy!\\'\\'\\n::\\'\\'You\\'ve travelled far, you’re very near, the waiting’s been long,\\'\\'\\n::\\'\\'But smoking, drinking, eating, one and all, are very wrong.\\'\\'\\n::\\'\\'Now thank you for listening.

The questions vary in style and do not necessarily have four answers (one for each house). There are 27 questions in all, and each user can be asked a maximum of 7, or 8 if the hat can not decide between houses and asks your opinion. Generally, a set of a few questions can be given to a user for each question, there are, of course, occasional exceptions to the order.\\nh1.JPG|Q: How would you most like to be known to history?

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was divided into four Houses: Gryffindor, founded by Godric Gryffindor; Hufflepuff, founded by Helga Hufflepuff; Ravenclaw, founded by Rowena Ravenclaw; and Slytherin, founded by Salazar Slytherin.\\n\\n\\n==House systems==\\nHouses at Hogwarts were both the living and learning communities for its students. Each year\\'s group of students in the same House shares the same dormitory and many classes. The houses compete throughout the school year, by earning and losing points for behaviour. The House with the most points wins the House Cup. Each House also has its own Quidditch team that competes for the Inter-House Quidditch Cup. These two competitions breed rivalries between the Houses, the greatest of which is that between Gryffindor and Slytherin.\\n\\n\\n===Sorting===\\nIn the early days of Hogwarts, the four founders handpicked students for their Houses. When the founders worried how students would be selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his hat off and each \"put some brains\" in it, creating the Sorting Hat to choose future students for each House. At the beginning of each school year, the magical Sorting Hat is placed on each new student\\'s head during the Sorting ceremony.\\nThe Sorting Hat announces the House the student is to join. Before beginning the Sorting ceremony, it sings a short song about the founding of the school and the four Houses; the Sorting Hat\\'s songs are different every year, and the Hat is said to take all year composing the next one (according to Ronald Weasley). Every so often it would sing of mortal peril at the school. The students say that it picks up tips from Dumbledore\\'s office.\\n\\n\\n===Qualities===\\nIt is unclear if the Sorting Hat tended to place students based on qualities they valued or rather qualities they exhibited. One example of the former is Peter Pettigrew, who was sorted into Gryffindor but ultimately turned out to be quite cowardly, self-serving and corruptible. He may have been placed there because, at the time, he admired strong, brave individuals like James Potter and Sirius Black. Other examples include Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, who despite being stupid and rather lazy, were placed in Slytherin, the House of the cunning and ambitious. They flocked around Draco Malfoy, who they admired and who exhibited the traits of Slytherin. Hermione Granger, while more than clever enough for Ravenclaw, valued courage above all, and was sorted into Gryffindor, a House she said sounded \"by far the best\".\\nThe Sorting Hat could detect nascent qualities in a student and place them in the House that would challenge them and put their character to the test. Case in point, Neville Longbottom was sorted into Gryffindor because the Hat sensed that he was capable of demonstrating bravery and leadership during his time at Hogwarts. However, these qualities did not fully surface until Neville learned to believe in himself.\\nThe Hat also appeared to take the students\\' wishes into account, considering how one\\'s personal choices are very much of a reflection of the qualities that they valued in themselves. Just because someone was placed in a certain House did not mean that they could not display characteristics of other Houses. Harry Potter, for instance, embodied many of the traits that were approved and appreciated by Salazar Slytherin. He was clever, resourceful and cunning, yet the Sorting Hat made him a Gryffindor because the very fact that he asked not to be in Slytherin showed that he did not belong there. A true Slytherin would not have had any doubts about whether or not it was the right House for them.\\nOne of the biggest examples of this was Severus Snape. At one point, Albus Dumbledore observed that his loyal, courageous nature was much more befitted to Gryffindor. However, as a child, Snape\\'s sadism, disdain for Muggles, and sheer cunning and ambition may have led to his being sorted into Slytherin when he first came to Hogwarts.\\n\\n\\n===House dynamics===\\nThe four Houses are rather separate entities. Each has its own common room and dormitory, its own table in the Great Hall, and students mostly share lessons with classmates of their same House. There is no rule against students from different houses mingling, but in practice, a good majority of social interactions occur within the same house. Each house had one teacher who acted as its Head of House. Each House also had a House ghost. The function they serve (if any) is unknown, although they might be like House mascots. Each Head of House and House Ghost was previously a pupil within that House.\\nA great deal of rivalry exists between the Houses, not always friendly. This rivalry was demonstrated in the Quidditch matches and the annual school competition for the House Cup, which was determined by the number of points earned or lost by each member of the rival Houses. These points were awarded or taken based on students\\' conduct throughout the school year. All members of the faculty and the Head Boy and Girl have the authority to grant and deduct points as they see fit in each instance. Some, like Severus Snape, the former Potions master, tended to favour their own house, but that does not seem to be against the rules. He was despised by many students, other than those in Slytherin, where he was very popular. \\nIt was not known how much favouritism the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw Heads showed, although it can be deduced that it was minimal or non-existent, as both Professor Filius Flitwick, Head of Ravenclaw, and Professor Pomona Sprout, Head of Hufflepuff, were kind, lighthearted people, who obviously wanted to win the House and Quidditch Cups but were not as vindictive as Snape in going about it. It is known that Professor Minerva McGonagall, the stern head of Gryffindor, did not show much favouritism towards her House. In fact, she deducted 50 points apiece and awarded detentions to three students in her House (Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and\\xa0Neville Longbottom\\xa0when they were caught out of bed after hours in Harry\\'s first year), and supported Professor Snape wholeheartedly in giving Harry detentions for the rest of the school year, even on overlapping Quidditch matches, after Harry used the Sectumsempra spell on Draco Malfoy in Harry\\'s sixth year.\\nAccording to Rubeus Hagrid, \"\\'\\'There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin\\'\\',\" (though this is, for the most part correct, there are a few exceptions, former Gryffindor Peter Pettigrew the most notable of them). None of this necessarily means, however, that all Slytherins are evil, such as Horace Slughorn, Regulus Black, Andromeda Black, and Narcissa Malfoy for example. Slytherins were chosen for their cunning and ambition. Although founder Salazar Slytherin favoured pure-blood students, it was not a condition of being sorted into Slytherin House as both Tom Riddle and Snape were Half-blood Slytherins. \\nIt has also been said that all four Houses must band together and fight as one if Hogwarts is to stand. It must be remembered that all of the Houses had their virtues and flaws: none were inherently good or evil. Slytherins may have earned their reputation as evil because they showed such contempt towards Gryffindor, the protagonist House. They also did not show much generosity towards other Houses either, whether those in them were pure-blood or not.\\nHouse rivalry was mostly seen between Slytherin and Gryffindor (\"Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each other on principle\"). This rivalry likely goes back to the days of Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin after they founded Hogwarts because the Sorting Hat said that they were the best of friends before they founded the school. While it is not clear if there is a similar rivalry between Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, it seems fairly unlikely due to the cheerful disposition of the Heads for said Houses, as opposed to the contempt of Professor Snape and the passion of Professor McGonagall. (Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff, however, once great friends, are documented as having had a severe falling out at some point by the Sorting Hat\\'s song in 1996.) \\nIt was sometimes thought that there was some dislike between the members of Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff due to the Ravenclaw students\\' reputation for boasting about their intelligence, which often annoyed Hufflepuffs, who were known for being modest, gentle and kind. As a whole, Gryffindors were thought to get on best with Hufflepuffs, whereas Ravenclaws were thought to be quite friendly with Slytherins. There are certain exceptions, however, such as Harry\\'s friendliness with Cho Chang and Luna Lovegood, both from Ravenclaw, as well as Cho\\'s relationship with Cedric Diggory, a Hufflepuff.\\nUsually, though not always, the other two Houses appeared (in Harry\\'s eyes) to support Gryffindor in its rivalry with Slytherin, which again is reminiscent of how Slytherin was in the end opposed by all three of the other founders. One exception to this occurred when Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin all initially supported Hufflepuff\\'s Cedric Diggory instead of Gryffindor\\'s Harry Potter in the Triwizard Tournament. Also in the first Quidditch match of 1996, it was said that many of the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had \"taken sides\" in the Gryffindor vs Slytherin match but does not specify which Houses took which side.\\n\\n\\n===Gryffindor===\\nGryffindor values bravery, daring, nerve, and chivalry. Its emblematic animal is the lion and its colours are scarlet and gold. Minerva McGonagall was the most recent Head of Gryffindor. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as \"Nearly Headless Nick\", was the House Ghost. The founder of the House was Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor corresponds to the element of Fire. The common room was located in one of the highest towers at Hogwarts, the entrance was situated on the seventh floor in the east wing of the castle and is guarded by a portrait of The Fat Lady. She permits entrance if given the correct password, which is changed numerous times throughout the school year. Famous Gryffindors include Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter, and Minerva McGonagall.\\n\\n\\n===Hufflepuff===\\nHufflepuff values hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play. Its emblematic animal is the badger, and Yellow and Black are its colours. Pomona Sprout was the Head of Hufflepuff during 1991-1998, Sprout left the post of Head of Hufflepuff and Herbology Professor sometime before 2017 and her successor for the position of Head of Hufflepuff is currently unknown. The Fat Friar is its ghost. The founder of the House was Helga Hufflepuff.  \\nHufflepuff corresponds to the element of earth. The Hufflepuff dormitories and common room are located somewhere in the basement, near the castle\\'s kitchens. It can be accessed by tapping the barrel two from the bottom, middle of the second row in the rhythm of \"Helga Hufflepuff\" and is described as being a cosy and welcoming place with yellow hangings, fat armchairs, and underground tunnels that lead to the dormitories, which have perfectly round doors, similar to barrel tops. Famous Hufflepuffs include Hengist of Woodcroft (founder of Hogsmeade), Newt Scamander (author of ), and Artemisia Lufkin (first female minister for magic). \\n\\n\\n===Ravenclaw===\\nRavenclaw values intelligence, knowledge, and wit. Its emblematic animal is the eagle, and its colours are blue and bronze. The Ravenclaw Head of House in the 1990s was Filius Flitwick. The ghost of Ravenclaw is the Grey Lady, who was the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, the House\\'s founder. Ravenclaw corresponds to the element of air. The Ravenclaw common room and dormitories are located in a tower on the west side of the castle. Ravenclaw students must answer a riddle as opposed to giving a password to enter their dormitories. This riddle, however, can be answered by non-Ravenclaws. Famous Ravenclaws include Luna Lovegood, Gilderoy Lockheart, Ignatia Wildsmith (inventor of Floo powder), and Garrick Ollivander.\\n\\n\\n===Slytherin===\\nSlytherin House values ambition, cunning and resourcefulness and was founded by Salazar Slytherin. Its emblematic animal is the serpent, and its colours are emerald green and silver. Professor Horace Slughorn was the Head of Slytherin during the 1997–1998 school year, replacing Severus Snape, who as well, replaced Slughorn as Potions Professor when he retired for the first time several years prior. Slytherin had produced the most Death Eaters and Dark Wizards, including Tom Riddle, Bellatrix Black. But that does not mean that other Houses haven’t produced any; Peter Pettigrew was a Gryffindor, and Quirinus Quirrell was a Ravenclaw. \\nThe Bloody Baron is the House Ghost. The founder of the House was Salazar Slytherin.  Slytherin corresponds roughly to the element of water. The Slytherin dormitories and common room are reached through a bare stone wall in the Dungeons. The Slytherin common room lies beneath the Black Lake. It is a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and silver lamps hanging from the ceiling. Famous Slytherins include Merlin, Tom Riddle, Draco Malfoy, and Dolores Umbridge.\\n\\n\\n==Behind the scenes==\\n*Each House represents one of the four classical elements: Fire (Gryffindor), Earth (Hufflepuff), Air (Ravenclaw), and Water (Slytherin). Each of these also represents one of the four states of matter: Plasma (Fire, Gryffindor), Gas (Air, Ravenclaw), Liquid (Water, Slytherin), and Solid (Earth, Hufflepuff). \\n\\n\\n==Trivia==\\n*Harry Potter fans can be sorted into Houses on Wizarding World (website)\\n\\n\\n==External links==\\n* Interview with J.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Pottermore Introductions to Hogwarts Houses\\nThese introductions were given by after sorting on the original Pottermore website. \\n\\n\\n==Gryffindor==\\nCongratulations! I’m Prefect Percy Weasley, and I’m delighted to welcome you to GRYFFINDOR HOUSE. Our emblem is the lion, the bravest of all creatures; our house colours are scarlet and gold, and our common room lies up in Gryffindor Tower.\\nThis is, quite simply, the best house at Hogwarts. It’s where the bravest and boldest end up – for instance: Albus Dumbledore! Yes, Dumbledore himself, the greatest wizard of our time, was a Gryffindor! If that’s not enough for you, I don’t know what it is.\\nI won’t keep you long, as all you need to do to find out more about your house is to follow Harry Potter and his friends as I lead them up to their dormitories. Enjoy your time at Hogwarts – but how could you fail to? You’ve become part of the best house in the school.\\n\\n\\n==Slytherin==\\nCongratulations! I’m Prefect Gemma Farley, and I’m delighted to welcome you to SLYTHERIN HOUSE. Our emblem is the serpent, the wisest of creatures; our house colours are emerald green and silver, and our common room lies behind a concealed entrance down in the dungeons. As you’ll see, its windows look out into the depths of the Hogwarts lake. We often see the giant squid swooshing by – and sometimes more interesting creatures. We like to feel that our hangout has the aura of a mysterious, underwater shipwreck.\\nNow, there are a few things you should know about Slytherin – and a few you should forget.\\nFirstly, let’s dispel a few myths. You might have heard rumours about Slytherin house – that we’re all into the Dark Arts, and will only talk to you if your great-grandfather was a famous wizard, and rubbish like that. Well, you don’t want to believe everything you hear from competing houses. I’m not denying that we’ve produced our share of Dark wizards, but so have the other three houses – they just don’t like admitting it. And yes, we have traditionally tended to take students who come from long lines of witches and wizards, but nowadays you’ll find plenty of people in Slytherin house who have at least one Muggle parent.\\nHere’s a little-known fact that the other three houses don’t bring up much: Merlin was a Slytherin. Yes, Merlin himself, the most famous wizard in history! He learned all he knew in this very house! Do you want to follow in the footsteps of Merlin? Or would you rather sit at the old desk of that illustrious ex-Hufflepuff, Eglantine Puffett, inventor of the Self-Soaping Dishcloth?\\nBut that’s enough about what we’re not. Let’s talk about what we are, which is the coolest and edgiest house in this school. We play to win, because we care about the honour and traditions of Slytherin.\\nWe also get respect from our fellow students. Yes, some of that respect might be tinged with fear, because of our Dark reputation, but you know what? It can be fun, having a reputation for walking on the wild side. Chuck out a few hints that you’ve got access to a whole library of curses, and see whether anyone feels like nicking your pencil case.\\nBut we’re not bad people. We’re like our emblem, the snake: sleek, powerful, and frequently misunderstood.\\nFor instance, we Slytherins look after our own – which is more than you can say for Ravenclaw. Apart from being the biggest bunch of swots you ever met, Ravenclaws are famous for clambering over each other to get good marks, whereas we Slytherins are brothers. The corridors of Hogwarts can throw up surprises for the unwary, and you’ll be glad you’ve got the Serpents on your side as you move around the school. As far as we’re concerned, once you’ve become a snake, you’re one of ours – one of the elite.\\nBecause you know what Salazar Slytherin looked for in his chosen students? The seeds of greatness. You’ve been chosen by this house because you’ve got the potential to be great, in the true sense of the word. All right, you might see a couple of people hanging around the common room whom you might not think are destined for anything special. Well, keep that to yourself. If the Sorting Hat put them in here, there’s something great about them, and don’t you forget it.\\nAnd talking of people who aren’t destined for greatness, I haven’t mentioned the Gryffindors. Now, a lot of people say that Slytherins and Gryffindors represent two sides of the same coin. Personally, I think Gryffindors are nothing more than wannabe Slytherins. Mind you, some people say that Salazar Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor prized the same kinds of students, so perhaps we are more similar than we like to think. But that doesn’t mean that we cosy up with Gryffindors. They like beating us only slightly less than we like beating them.\\nA few more things you might need to know: our house ghost is the Bloody Baron. If you get on the right side of him he’ll sometimes agree to frighten people for you. Just don’t ask him how he got bloodstained; he doesn’t like it.\\nThe password to the common room changes every fortnight. Keep an eye on the noticeboard. Never bring anyone from another house into our common room or tell them our password. No outsider has entered it for more than seven centuries.\\nWell, I think that’s all for now. I’m sure you’ll like our dormitories. We sleep in ancient four-posters with green silk hangings, and bedspreads embroidered with silver thread. Medieval tapestries depicting the adventures of famous Slytherins cover the walls, and silver lanterns hang from the ceilings. You’ll sleep well; it’s very soothing, listening to the lake water lapping against the windows at night.\\n\\n\\n==Hufflepuff==\\nCongratulations! I’m Prefect Gabriel Truman, and I’m delighted to welcome you to HUFFLEPUFF HOUSE. Our emblem is the badger, an animal that is often underestimated, because it lives quietly until attacked, but which, when provoked, can fight off animals much larger than itself, including wolves. Our house colours are yellow and black, and our common room lies one floor below the ground, on the same corridor as the kitchens.\\nNow, there are a few things you should know about Hufflepuff house. First of all, let’s deal with a perennial myth about the place, which is that we’re the least clever house. WRONG. Hufflepuff is certainly the least boastful house, but we’ve produced just as many brilliant witches and wizards as any other. Want proof? Look up Grogan Stump, one of the most popular Ministers for Magic of all time. He was a Hufflepuff – as were the successful Ministers Artemesia Lufkin and Dugald McPhail. Then there’s the world authority on magical creatures, Newt Scamander; Bridget Wenlock, the famous thirteenth-century Arithmancer who first discovered the magical properties of the number seven, and Hengist of Woodcroft, who founded the all-wizarding village of Hogsmeade, which lies very near Hogwarts School. Hufflepuffs all.\\nSo, as you can see, we’ve produced more than our fair share of powerful, brilliant and daring witches and wizards, but, just because we don’t shout about it, we don’t get the credit we deserve. Ravenclaws, in particular, assume that any outstanding achiever must have come from their house. I got into big trouble during my third year for duelling a Ravenclaw prefect who insisted that Bridget Wenlock had come from his house, not mine. I should have got a week of detentions, but Professor Sprout let me off with a warning and a box of coconut ice.\\nHufflepuffs are trustworthy and loyal. We don’t shoot our mouths off, but cross us at your peril; like our emblem, the badger, we will protect ourselves, our friends and our families against all-comers. Nobody intimidates us.\\nHowever, it’s true that Hufflepuff is a bit lacking in one area. We’ve produced the fewest Dark wizards of any house in this school. Of course, you’d expect Slytherin to churn out evil-doers, seeing as they’ve never heard of fair play and prefer cheating over hard work any day, but even Gryffindor (the house we get on best with) has produced a few dodgy characters.\\nWhat else do you need to know? Oh yes, the entrance to the common room is concealed in a stack of large barrels in a nook on the right hand side of the kitchen corridor. Tap the barrel two from the bottom, middle of the second row, in the rhythm of ‘Helga Hufflepuff’, and the lid will swing open. We are the only house at Hogwarts that also has a repelling device for would-be intruders. If the wrong lid is tapped, or if the rhythm of the tapping is wrong, the illegal entrant is doused in vinegar.\\nYou will hear other houses boast of their security arrangements, but it so happens that in more than a thousand years, the Hufflepuff common room and dormitories have never been seen by outsiders. Like badgers, we know exactly how to lie low – and how to defend ourselves.\\nOnce you’ve opened the barrel, crawl inside and along the passageway behind it, and you will emerge into the cosiest common room of them all. It is round and earthy and low-ceilinged; it always feels sunny, and its circular windows have a view of rippling grass and dandelions.\\nThere is a lot of burnished copper about the place, and many plants, which either hang from the ceiling or sit on the windowsills. Our Head of house, Professor Pomona Sprout, is Head of Herbology, and she brings the most interesting specimens (some of which dance and talk) to decorate our room – one reason why Hufflepuffs are often very good at Herbology. Our overstuffed sofas and chairs are upholstered in yellow and black, and our dormitories are reached through round doors in the walls of the common room. Copper lamps cast a warm light over our four-posters, all of which are covered in patchwork quilts, and copper bed warmers hang on the walls, should you have cold feet.\\nOur house ghost is the friendliest of them all: the Fat Friar. You’ll recognise him easily enough; he’s plump and wears monk’s robes, and he’s very helpful if you get lost or are in any kind of trouble.\\nI think that’s nearly everything. I must say, I hope some of you are good Quidditch players. Hufflepuff hasn’t done as well as I’d like in the Quidditch tournament lately.\\nYou should sleep comfortably. We’re protected from storms and wind down in our dormitories; we never have the disturbed nights those in the towers sometimes experience.\\nAnd once again: congratulations on becoming a member of the friendliest, most decent and most tenacious house of them all.\\n\\n\\n==Ravenclaw==\\nCongratulations! I’m Prefect Robert Hilliard, and I’m delighted to welcome you to RAVENCLAW HOUSE. Our emblem is the eagle, which soars where others cannot climb; our house colours are blue and bronze, and our common room is found at the top of Ravenclaw Tower, behind a door with an enchanted knocker. The arched windows set into the walls of our circular common room look down at the school grounds: the lake, the Forbidden Forest, the Quidditch pitch and the Herbology gardens. No other house in the school has such stunning views.\\nWithout wishing to boast, this is the house where the cleverest witches and wizards live. Our founder, Rowena Ravenclaw, prized learning above all else – and so do we. Unlike the other houses, who all have concealed entrances to their common rooms, we don’t need one. The door to our common room lies at the top of a tall, winding staircase. It has no handle, but an enchanted bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle. When you rap on the door, this knocker will ask you a question, and if you can answer it correctly, you are allowed in. This simple barrier has kept out everyone but Ravenclaws for nearly a thousand years.\\nSome first-years are scared by having to answer the eagle’s questions, but don’t worry. Ravenclaws learn quickly, and you’ll soon enjoy the challenges the door sets. It’s not unusual to find twenty people standing outside the common room door, all trying to work out the answer to the day’s question together. This is a great way to meet fellow Ravenclaws from other years, and to learn from them – although it is a bit annoying if you’ve forgotten your Quidditch robes and need to get in and out in a hurry. In fact, I’d advise you to triple-check your bag for everything you need before leaving Ravenclaw Tower.\\nAnother cool thing about Ravenclaw is that our people are the most individual – some might even call them eccentrics. But geniuses are often out of step with ordinary folk, and unlike some other houses we could mention, we think you’ve got the right to wear what you like, believe what you want, and say what you feel. We aren’t put off by people who march to a different tune; on the contrary, we value them!\\nSpeaking of eccentrics, you’ll like our Head of house, Professor Filius Flitwick. People often underestimate him, because he’s really tiny (we think he’s part elf, but we’ve never been rude enough to ask) and he’s got a squeaky voice, but he’s the best and most knowledgeable Charms master alive in the world today. His office door is always open to any Ravenclaw with a problem, and if you’re in a real state he’ll get out these delicious little cupcakes he keeps in a tin in his desk drawer and make them do a little dance for you. In fact, it’s worth pretending you’re in a real state just to see them jive.\\nRavenclaw house has an illustrious history. Most of the greatest wizarding inventors and innovators were in our house, including Perpetua Fancourt, the inventor of the lunascope, Laverne de Montmorency, a great pioneer of love potions, and Ignatia Wildsmith, the inventor of Floo powder. Famous Ravenclaw Ministers for Magic include Millicent Bagnold, who was in power on the night that Harry Potter survived the Dark Lord’s curse, and defended the wizarding celebrations all over Britain with the words, ‘I assert our inalienable right to party. There was also Minister Lorcan McLaird, who was a quite brilliant wizard, but preferred to communicate by puffing smoke out of the end of his wand. Well, I did say we produce eccentrics. In fact, we are also the house that gave the wizarding world Uric the Oddball, who used a jellyfish for a hat. He’s the punch line of a lot of wizarding jokes.\\nAs for our relationship with the other three houses: well, you’ve probably heard about the Slytherins. They’re not all bad, but you’d do well to be on your guard until you know them well. They’ve got a long house tradition of doing whatever it takes to win – so watch out, especially in Quidditch matches and exams.\\nThe Gryffindors are OK. If I had a criticism, I’d say Gryffindors tend to be show-offs. They’re also much less tolerant than we are of people who are different; in fact, they’ve been known to make jokes about Ravenclaws who have developed an interest in levitation, or the possible magical uses of troll bogies, or ovomancy, which (as you probably know) is a method of divination using eggs. Gryffindors haven’t got our intellectual curiosity, whereas we’ve got no problem if you want to spend your days and nights cracking eggs in a corner of the common room and writing down your predictions according to the way the yolks fall. In fact, you’ll probably find a few people to help you.\\nAs for the Hufflepuffs, well, nobody could say they’re not nice people. In fact, they’re some of the nicest people in the school. Let’s just say you needn’t worry too much about them when it comes to competition at exam time.\\nI think that’s nearly everything. Oh yes, our house ghost is the Grey Lady. The rest of the school thinks she never speaks, but she’ll talk to Ravenclaws. She’s particularly useful if you’re lost, or you’ve mislaid something.\\nI’m sure you’ll have a good night. Our dormitories are in turrets off the main tower; our four-poster beds are covered in sky blue silk eiderdowns and the sound of the wind whistling around the windows is very relaxing.\\nAnd once again: well done on becoming a member of the cleverest, quirkiest and most interesting house at Hogwarts.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.8314463250737854, 'meta': {'url': 'https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pottermore_Introductions_to_Hogwarts_Houses', 'name': 'Pottermore_Introductions_to_Hogwarts_Houses'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '58aaccc5b226ee49602faba10b036d98'}>],\n",

On occasion, Hogwarts staff also went into the village on Hogsmeade weekends, but they were otherwise allowed to visit any time they wanted.\\nArticle 528/2 of the 1714 Edict established rules for the weekend trips.\\n\\n\\n===1993-1994===\\nIn 1993, Harry Potter\\'s uncle Vernon Dursley agreed to sign his permission form only on the condition that he behave \"normally\" while Vernon\\'s sister Marge visited them. Since Harry blew up Aunt Marge and ran away from Privet Drive, his form was never signed.\\nHarry attempted to persuade both the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge and Professor McGonagall to sign his form for him. Both refused since \\'\\'only\\'\\' a parent or guardian could give permission. Fudge thought it was for the best that Harry stay out of the village while Sirius Black was on the loose.\\nOther students offered ways to get Harry into Hogsmeade. Dean Thomas offered to forge Dursley\\'s signature for him, but Harry declined, stating that it would not work, as he had already asked Professor McGonagall to go. At the beginning of the Christmas holidays, Harry managed to subvert the rules and get into Hogsmeade after Fred and George Weasley gave him the Marauder\\'s Map. Harry also used his Invisibility Cloak during his second trip.\\nWhen Sirius Black gained entrance to Gryffindor Tower, having acquired the passwords to the Fat Lady\\'s painting from Crookshanks, who stole the list from Neville Longbottom\\'s bedside table, Neville was banned from all future trips for the year.\\nThe final Hogsmeade visit of the year was held on the Saturday following Sirius Black and Buckbeak\\'s escape. Ron and Hermione decided not to go. Instead they remained at Hogwarts with Harry, and they wandered the grounds together. Remus Lupin resigned that morning and left the castle while the students were still at Hogsmeade, to avoid their reactions after Severus Snape exposed him as a werewolf.\\n\\n\\n===1994-1995===\\nBefore the 1994–1995 school year, Sirius Black, Harry\\'s godfather, sent Harry a note giving him permission to visit Hogsmeade. The first Hogsmeade visit of the year occurred\\xa0on \\'the Saturday before the First Task\\' (19 November 1994) of the Triwizard Tournament. Harry used the Invisibility Cloak to avoid the unwanted attention the tournament was providing him with.\\nThe second trip was halfway through January 1995. Harry, Ron, and Hermione went to the Three Broomsticks, where they ran into Ludo Bagman and the goblins he was indebted to, as well as Rita Skeeter, who had recently published an insulting article about Rubeus Hagrid in the \\'\\'Daily Prophet\\'\\'. These encounters respectively confused and offended them, and Hermione lashed out at Skeeter, before they left the village to go confront the reclusive Hagrid.\\nAnother was held in March. Sirius used this Hogsmeade visit as an opportunity to speak face-to-face with Harry and his friends in his cave near the village about the Triwizard Tournament and the histories of certain people then at Hogwarts, such as Severus Snape and Igor Karkaroff, both of whom were former Death Eaters.\\n\\n\\n===1995-1996===\\nIn 1995, Hermione Granger and Harry led the first Dumbledore\\'s Army meeting in the Hog\\'s Head, which was coincidentally owned by Albus Dumbledore\\'s brother, Aberforth.\\nOn Valentine\\'s Day, Harry went on a date with Cho Chang to Madam Puddifoot\\'s Tea Shop, though it ended with an argument; with Harry promising to meet with Hermione earlier, and Harry refusing to talk about Cedric Diggory\\'s death, Cho left a confused Harry alone after her attempt to make him jealous as a method of gauging his feelings for her failed. At Hermione\\'s arrangement, Harry also gave an interview to Rita Skeeter about his experiences in the Little Hangleton graveyard the previous year, conducted in the Three Broomsticks pub. It was later published in \\'\\'The Quibbler\\'\\'. Professor Umbridge banned Harry from going to Hogsmeade, adding to the cruelty that she inflicted on him during his fifth year.\\n\\n\\n===1996-1997===\\nDuring the first Hogsmeade trip of the year, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger came across the event where Katie Bell was cursed by the Opal Necklace while she was under the influence of Madam Rosmerta\\'s Imperius Curse, who was in turn under Draco Malfoy\\'s Imperius Curse. Draco was not permitted to go for the first trip due to him doing detention with Minerva McGonagall for failing to hand in his Transfiguration homework twice, which actually shielded him from Harry\\'s accusation of the necklace incident. Due to this near-death experience, further Hogsmeade trips were cancelled for the year.\\nRon Weasley\\'s birthday fell on what would have been another day for a Hogsmeade trip, but it was later cancelled. Ron was accidentally poisoned in Horace Slughorn\\'s office early the same morning. When visiting Ron in the Hospital Wing, Fred and George expressed their intention of buying Zonko\\'s Joke Shop as a Hogsmeade branch of their joke shop; however, they felt the cancellation of Hogsmeade trips made it pointless as it meant no students would visit the branch.\\n\\n\\n===2020===\\nThird year Albus Potter rejected his father Harry\\'s permission to let him go to Hogsmeade, burning the permission slip as a means to spite his father. Later that year, when Albus and his best friend Scorpius Malfoy had been found using an illegal \"true\" Time-Turner to cause severe amounts of time-disruptions, which they successfully restored, Headmistress Minerva McGonagall punished them as severe as she could in lieu of outright expulsion, one of which was to revoke their rights to visit Hogsmeade ever again.\\n\\n\\n==Schedule==\\nThere did not seem to be an exact schedule of Hogsmeade visits.

Unknown to Filch, this passage was discovered somehow by James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew, who included it on the Marauder’s Map; Fred and George Weasley then used it extensively, and eventually taught Harry Potter how to get through it as well.\\n*Whomping Willow to the Shrieking Shack: When Remus Lupin came to Hogwarts as a werewolf, this passageway was built (and the Whomping Willow planted) to give him a place to go when he transformed every full moon. The tunnel was accessed by prodding a knot on the trunk of the Whomping Willow to immobilise the tree, and it lead to the basement of the Shrieking Shack.\\n*The Room of Requirement to the Hog’s Head Inn: A secret passage that “opened” in 1998 to allow renegade Hogwarts students who were in hiding to access food. Though the door was in plain sight in the Room of Requirement, the passageway could only be accessed from the Hog’s Head through the portrait of Ariana Dumbledore on the second floor of the inn.\\n*A secret passageway behind the mirror on the fourth floor: Fred and George Weasley used this passageway, also unknown to Filch, extensively until it caved in c. winter 1992.\\n*Four secret passageways that Filch knows about: Not all of these passages necessarily lead to Hogsmeade, though \\'\\'“most of them” probably do.

He attacked the boys after they inflicted severe mental and emotional damage on his daughter Ariana. Albus and his mother Kendra, sister Ariana, and brother Aberforth lived here, until Kendra\\'s and Ariana\\'s tragic and accidental deaths. At the time, Bathilda Bagshot was their neighbour and eventually became a good friend of the family, privy to the family\\'s many secrets.\\n\\n\\n===Three-way duel===\\nIn 1899, a three-way duel broke out between Gellert Grindelwald, Albus Dumbledore, and Aberforth Dumbledore. The duel took place after Aberforth angered Grindelwald. He attacked Aberforth, using the Cruciatus Curse on him. Albus stepped in, attempting to defend his younger brother and stop the two fighting.\\xa0Ariana Dumbledore tried to help, but did not know what she was doing and was inadvertently killed. This experience haunted Albus until his death.\\n\\n\\n===Murder of the Potters===\\nVoldemort arrives at Godric\\'s Hollow intending to murder Harry Potter in 1981\\nHaving been told half of the prophecy by Severus Snape, Voldemort came to believe his mortal enemy to be Harry Potter. After being given the Potters location by a trusted friend of the family (Peter Pettigrew) he travelled to the Potters\\' home in Godric\\'s Hollow. On 31 October, 1981, James and Lily Potter were murdered by Lord Voldemort in their home as they tried to protect their son. Voldemort lost his powers and physical form when he tried to murder infant Harry, due to Lily\\'s loving sacrifice. James and Lily\\'s bodies were laid to rest together in the Godric\\'s Hollow graveyard. Their tombstone reads, \"\\'\\'The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.\\'\\'\"\\nStatue of James, Lily, and Harry Potter in the centre of the village\\nA statue was later erected at the centre of the village square in\\xa0Godric\\'s Hollow in memory of James and Lily Potter and a dedication to Harry Potter. It\\'s unknown exactly when it was erected and it can be assumed it was commissioned by the wizarding population of the Hollow, and the wider wizarding community of Great Britain.\\nFrom a distance, the statue appeared as an obelisk, carved with the names of people who died in a war (presumably\\xa0Muggle casualties of World War I or World War II). While Muggles can see only this obelisk, a\\xa0witch or wizard\\xa0can see that the memorial changed into a statue of a\\xa0family\\xa0as he or she approached. It was also said by Harry Potter that in winter time, when snow gathered on the statue\\'s heads, that the carvings appeared to be wearing white fur hats.\\n\\n\\n===Harry\\'s visit and Nagini\\'s attack===\\nThe Graveyard in Godric\\'s Hallow, during Christmas time\\nHarry Potter and Hermione Granger visited Godric\\'s Hollow in 1997 to find Bathilda Bagshot. They had hoped that Bathilda had the Sword of Gryffindor, which they needed to destroy Lord Voldemort\\'s Horcruxes. Harry first had the idea that he needed to visit Godric\\'s Hollow following the death of Albus Dumbledore, simply getting a feeling that he needed to go there. While there, Harry visited for the first time both his parents\\' graves and their former home. According to the sign that had been set in the ground outside of the cottage, had been preserved in \"\\'\\'its ruined state as a monument to the Potters and as a reminder of the violence that tore apart their family.\\'\\'\"\\nThe Potters\\' ruined cottage in Godric\\'s Hollow\\nThis sign was graffitied over the years with names and messages of support for Harry, something that he thought was touching. The house, like the statue, had been made invisible to Muggles. During the same visit, they were attacked by Nagini, disguised as Bathilda Bagshot. Lord Voldemort had previously murdered Bathilda and used Dark Magic to conceal Nagini within her corpse. She could not speak, however, except in Parseltongue, and communicated mainly through gesturing.\\nNagini attacking Harry in Bathilda Bagshot\\'s home in Godric\\'s Hollow\\nAfter Nagini lured Harry away from Hermione and verified his identity, she telepathically contacted Voldemort, who told her to hold him. However, Hermione intervened, blasting the snake away and Disapparating with Harry just as Voldemort arrived. During the struggle, Harry\\'s wand was inadvertently broken by Hermione\\'s miscast curse. He was therefore required to use a new wand for the remainder of the hunt.\\n\\n\\n==Appearances==\\nThe cottages that reside in the hollow\\nThe Hollow was described as being quaint. There was a narrow road with look-a-like cottages that resided on either side of it. There was streetlights at the centre of the village indicating it as the square. There was also a little church, and behind it, the village\\'s graveyard. The graveyard was described as having row upon row of tombstones, some very old. The headstones showed members of different wizarding families that were buried there, such as an Abbott and Ignotus Peverell.\\n\\n\\n==Wizarding population==\\nBathilda Bagshot\\'s note that Godric\\'s Hollow was the home of a relatively large number of wizards does not indicate that it was a purely Wizarding village; in fact, Hogsmeade village was the only purely Wizarding village in Britain. As such, wizard residents of Godric\\'s Hollow still had to avoid open use of magic to avoid disturbing the Muggle residents of the village. This is why the monuments to the Potter family were hidden.\\nSimilarly, the Potter cottage on the edge of the village was charmed to be invisible to Muggles. One must assume that a charm similar to the one that hides 12 Grimmauld Place must have been in use at the latter site, to prevent Muggles from trying to build on the apparently empty lot as the village grew. Given the Dumbledore family experience with Muggles, it was a little surprising that the family chose to settle at Godric\\'s Hollow rather than Hogsmeade. However, it is possible that there was some family history that connected the family to this village; and it seems likely that the Dumbledore family chose to live in a part of the village that was primarily wizard-occupied.\\n\\n\\n===Residents===\\nGodric\\'s Hollow was one of the places where magical families had come to live alongside Muggles. Over the centuries, it was home to many wizards and witches of note, including Godric Gryffindor, who was born there, and Bowman Wright, who forged the first Golden Snitch there in the Middle Ages.\\nOthers who called the village home were the Dumbledore family, the family of James and Lily Potter, and Bathilda Bagshot. Ignotus Peverell, pure-blood ancestor of Harry Potter, was born and subsequently buried at Godric\\'s Hollow.\\n\\n\\n==Geography==\\nGodric’s Hollow was located in the West Country of southwestern England, putting it in the heart of perhaps the most wizarding-friendly region in Britain. Ottery St Catchpole was in this area, as were Cornwall, Devon, several Quidditch teams, and a number of known Quidditch stadiums built on the abundant local moors.\\nHagrid’s flight from Godric’s Hollow to Surrey after picking up the infant Harry Potter took him over Bristol, suggesting that the town was located in the northern region of the West Country, near Exmoor and not far from the Bristol Channel. There is some question as to where Hagrid was actually flying from, however.\\nGodric Gryffindor was described as being from “wild moor”, suggesting again the rural nature of the town. The village seemed to have contained only a small number of dwellings overall, as the open country began a short distance from the square.\\nAt the centre of the village itself was a square with a post office, a pub, and a church with a graveyard behind it. In the middle of the square was a war memorial which, upon closer inspection by wizards, transformed into a statue of James, Lily, and young Harry —\\xa0a monument\\xa0to their final stand. The graveyard was the final resting place of many witches and wizards.\\n\\n\\n==Places of interests==\\nHome of James, Lily, and Harry Potter. Partly destroyed after Voldemort\\'s attack in 1981, it had been left in its ruined state and made invisible to Muggles, as a monument to the Potters and to Voldemort\\'s first downfall.\\nA statue depicting James and Lily Potter holding baby Harry.\\nThe house of Bathilda Bagshot.

The goal of the Seeker is to catch the Golden Snitch. They play a crucial role in Quidditch, as a game does not end until the Seeker catches the Snitch. A team whose Seeker catches the Snitch receives 150 points, which almost always wins the match for that team.\\n\\n\\n==History==\\nAn old game of Quidditch depicting a Seeker and a Golden Snitch\\nThe position of the Seeker, known as the \\'\\'Hunter\\'\\', was introduced in response to Barberus Bragge\\'s introduction of the Golden Snidget during a match in 1269 making it the newest position in the game.\\nThe 1269 game mentioned above was attended by Barberus Bragge, the Chief of the Wizards\\' Council. As a nod to the sport of Snidget-hunting, which was also popular at the time, Bragge brought such a bird to the game and released it from its cage. He told the players that one-hundred fifty Galleons — a large sum of money, particularly in those times — would be awarded to the player who caught the bird.\\nThis was easier said than done: the Snidget is very fast, very small, and can make sudden changes of direction at high speeds. The considerable challenge posed by the flight patterns of the bird is what made Snidget-hunting so popular in the first place.\\nWhat happened at the Quidditch game in question was rather predictable: the players totally ignored the game, and each and every one simply went off in pursuit of the Snidget, which was kept within the arena by the crowd using Repelling Charms.\\nA witch named Modesty Rabnott, who was also watching the game, took pity on the Snidget and rescued it with a Summoning Charm before rushing away with it hidden inside her robes. She was caught by a furious Bragge and fined ten Galleons for disrupting the game, but not before she had released the Snidget. This saved the life of this bird, but the connection with Quidditch had been made, and soon a Snidget was being released at every game. Each team had an extra player — originally called the \\'\\'Hunter\\'\\', later the Seeker — whose sole job was to catch and kill the Snidget, for which one-hundred fifty points were awarded in memory of the one-hundred fifty Galleons offered by Bragge in the original game.\\nThe quickly declining number of Snidgets led to a substitute for the bird, hence the Golden Snitch came into play, and the position was given the name Seeker instead of Hunter.\\nRegulus Black\\xa0was the Seeker of his\\xa0Slytherin Quidditch team, because of his position in the team photograph — middle, front row.\\nCharlie Weasley\\xa0was\\xa0a Gryffindor\\xa0Seeker.

       "  <Document: {'content': \"Gryffindor Keeper Ron Weasley defending the hoop\\nKeeper is a position in the Wizarding sport of Quidditch. There is one Keeper per team, and it is their job to guard the three goalposts attempting to stop the other team's Chasers from scoring. The keeper also wears the most protection than any other position, which includes a helmet, shoulder/chest pads and knee pads. This effectively makes them heavier than most of their other team-mates.\\n\\n\\n==History==\\nThe position of the Keeper has existed since at least the 13th century, although the role has changed somewhat over time. The Keeper was essentially a Chaser, with the added responsibilities of guarding the posts. However, with the addition of the scoring zone in 1620, Keepers generally kept inside this area in order to prevent the opposition from scoring. Keepers are only allowed out of this area to head off incoming Chasers. \\n\\n\\n==Traits==\\nKeepers are typically well-built and athletic players who usually stick close to the goal posts where they can deploy their defensive skills to their fullest capacity.\\n\\n\\n==Known Keepers==\\nAmerican National Quidditch team\\nAustralian National Quidditch team\\nBrazilian National Quidditch team\\nBulgarian National Quidditch team\\nEnglish National Quidditch team\\nHaitian National Quidditch team\\nJamaican National Quidditch team\\nJapanese National Quidditch team\\nNorwegian National Quidditch team\\nSpanish National Quidditch team\\n*Grenouille was a fictional keeper invented by Malecrit for the play Hélas, Je me suis Transfiguré Les Pieds.\\n\\n\\n==Behind the scenes==\\n*An unidentified Gryffindor Keeper during the 1985–1986 school year was known for misplacing the Broom Wax.\\n*Vicky Frobisher tried out for the role of Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, but was unsuccessful.\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.9401439928299422, 'meta': {'url': 'https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Keeper', 'name': 'Keeper'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'cfd51be0cb1fcd1656897ea2686de430'}>,\n",

It is currently unknown how the team performed during this time period.\\nDuring the 1953–1954 school year, Minerva McGonagall had a nasty fall (a foul during the Gryffindor vs Slytherin match, which would decide the Quidditch Cup winner) that left her with a concussion, several broken ribs, and a lifelong desire to see Slytherin crushed on the Quidditch pitch.\\n\\n\\n===1960s===\\nR.

It is currenty unknown how the team did during this time period.\\n\\n\\n===1970s===\\nJames Potter played as a Chaser for Gryffindor this decade. M. G. McGonagall played on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, winning an award for it in 1971. It is currently unknown how the team did during this time period.\\n\\n\\n===1980s===\\nDuring the 1985–1986 school year, Charles Weasley played as Seeker for Gryffindor, and Gryffindor won the Quidditch Cup. Gryffindor Quidditch team however failed to win the Quidditch Cup during school years of 1986–1987, 1987–1988, 1988–1989, and 1989–1990.\\n\\n\\n===1990-1991 school year===\\nAccording to Gryffindor Head of House, Minerva McGonagall, Gryffindor was \"flattened\" by Slytherin. Oliver Wood was Gryffindor\\'s Keeper and Fred and George Weasley were Beaters. Alicia Spinnet was only a reserve for Gryffindor this season.\\n\\n\\n===1991–1992 school year===\\nThe 1991 Gryffindor Quidditch team\\nWhen Harry Potter played during his first year at Hogwarts, he was the youngest player in more than a hundred years. He also had to be given special dispensation to have his own broomstick at school, (a Nimbus 2000). This was due to the fact that first years were not allowed their own brooms, most likely because of safety reasons. This broomstick was a present from the Head of Gryffindor house, Minerva McGonagall, delivered to him during breakfast in the Great Hall one morning. This was a racing broom that would come in handy regarding chasing and catching the elusive and incredibly fast Snitch. The Gryffindor Quidditch team practised three times a week under Oliver Wood\\'s very strict supervision.\\nHarry catches the Snitch, Gryffindor wins against Slytherin\\nThe opening game, Gryffindor versus Slytherin, was played on a cold November\\'s day. This was Harry Potter\\'s debut match. Angelina Johnson was first to score, shooting the Quaffle past Bletchley. The first time Harry spotted the Snitch, so did Higgs, but as Harry sped towards he was blocked by Flint. For this, Madam Hooch awarded a penalty which Alicia Spinnet scored, but the Seekers had lost sight of the Snitch. Professor Quirrell then began to magically interfere with Harry\\'s broom, but Harry was saved when Hermione Granger cast a spell to start a small fire in the stand that Quirrell was occupying. Harry regained control of his broom and caught the Snitch by accidentally swallowing it. Although Flint complained to Hooch, she judged the incident fair play and Gryffindor won the match 170-60.\\nProfessor Severus Snape refereed the Hufflepuff versus Gryffindor match. His decisions were biased in favour of Hufflepuff. Gryffindor Beater, George Weasley hit a Bludger at him. Harry caught the Snitch in record time and won the game for Gryffindor.\\nIn Harry\\'s absence at the hospital wing, Gryffindor was defeated in their final game of the season against Ravenclaw, costing them their chance at the Quidditch Cup that year.\\n\\n\\n===1992–1993 school year===\\nA team meeting involving tactics and strategies\\nWood planned to begin training before the other three sides. Unfortunately for Gryffindor, who had got up at the crack of dawn for their first training session, Slytherin had been given use of the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch by Severus Snape. Draco Malfoy the Slytherin team\\'s new Seeker called Hermione Granger a Mudblood. This happened after she insinuated that the only reason he made the team was because of his father\\'s generous donation of Nimbus 2001s. This accusation might have very well been the truth. To make matters worse Harry had to leave with Ron\\xa0after the spell Ron attempted to cast on Malfoy backfired, causing Ron to belch up slugs.\\nDuring the rainy Slytherin versus Gryffindor match, the Slytherin Chasers were dominant, taking a 60-0 lead at one point. Harry was relentlessly pursued by a rogue Bludger, so Oliver Wood called for a time-out. However, Harry agreed to play on, telling the Weasley twins to stop flying around him so he could pursue the Snitch. When the action resumed Harry was struck on the elbow by a Bludger, which broke his right arm. Despite this, when he spotted the Snitch he was able to chase after it and grasp it in his left hand, winning the match for Gryffindor. Gilderoy Lockhart then attempted to mend Harry\\'s broken arm, but instead removed the bone. Harry was given Skele-Gro in the Hospital Wing, where that night Dobby revealed it was he who had tampered with the Bludger.\\nIn anticipation of their next match against Hufflepuff, Wood insisted on Gryffindor team practises every night after dinner.\\nUnfortunately, the Quidditch Cup was completely cancelled due to attacks on Muggle-born students before the Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff match.\\n\\n\\n===1993–1994 school year===\\nIn the 1993–1994 school year, the team is said by Lee Jordan to be \"\\'\\'the best team Hogwarts has seen in the last few years\\'\\'\". This was the first year that they had won the Quidditch Cup since Charles Weasley was on the team. Gryffindor kept the same team as the previous year. It was seventeen-year-old captain Oliver Wood\\'s last season. They trained three times a week.\\nThe Slytherin versus Gryffindor match was re-scheduled as Flint claimed his Seeker, Malfoy had an injured arm, so the first match was Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff.\\nThe match right before a mass of Dementors converge on the Quidditch pitch\\nThe game was played in heavy rain, ferocious wind, thunder, and lightning. The wind was so powerful that the players staggered sideways as they walked onto the very muddy pitch. The sound of the thunder drowned out the crowd\\'s shouts. Madam Hooch\\'s whistle to start the match coincided with the first bolt of lightning. Harry\\'s vision was hindered by the constant raindrops on his glasses and he was almost struck by a Bludger twice.\\nWood called for a time-out when Gryffindor were fifty points up. Hermione Granger used \"Impervius\" so Harry\\'s glasses would repel any water. When both Seekers had spotted the Snitch, Harry then saw at least one hundred Dementors that had entered the stadium. He heard his mother\\'s last words before she was killed by Lord Voldemort and he fell about fifty feet to the ground. Albus Dumbledore ran onto the pitch waving his wand and slowing Harry\\'s fall. He then got rid of the Dementors, magicked Harry onto a stretcher and carried him to the castle floating upon it.\\nCedric caught the Snitch, giving Hufflepuff a win by 100 points. He offered a re-match, but Gryffindor accepted the defeat. Harry\\'s Nimbus 2000 was blown to the Whomping Willow which destroyed it.\\nGryffindor increased their training to five times a week (under the supervision of Madam Hooch) For a time, Harry used an old school Shooting Star as a substitute broom, but this changed when he received a Firebolt for Christmas (later revealed to be a gift from Sirius Black ordered via owl mail order).\\nGryffindor\\'s final practise before their match against Ravenclaw was their current side\\'s best ever, suggested to be the result of them being inspired by the Firebolt. Harry caught the Snitch within ten seconds of its release. The team performed their moves faultlessly and Wood had no criticisms, which Fred noted was a first.\\nHarry receives a Firebolt for Christmas that is soon confiscated by McGonagall\\nFor the game against Ravenclaw, Harry flew his new Firebolt. His opposing Seeker, fourth year Cho Chang, flew a Comet 260. In clear, cool conditions, Gryffindor took an eighty point lead, but Ravenclaw managed to claw it back to 80-30. When Harry spotted the Snitch for the third time, Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Flint walked onto the pitch, dressed as Dementors. Harry having been given anti-dementor lessons, shot his Patronus at them and then caught the Snitch. This gave Gryffindor a victory, whose fans ran onto the pitch in celebration. On the first Saturday after the Easter holidays, Gryffindor played Slytherin. Gryffindor had trained every day in preparation for the game. Slytherin were leading the Championship by exactly 200 points, meaning Gryffindor needed to win the match by 210 points to claim the Quidditch Cup.\\nThree-quarters of the crowd supported Gryffindor. Johnson scored first. Then Flint crashed into her, so Fred threw his bat at the back of Flint\\'s head which smashed into his broom handle, bloodying his nose. Penalties were given to each side. Alicia Spinnet scored and Wood saved. Bell scored another penalty after Montague grabbed her head. Flint then scored for Slytherin. Bole hit Alicia with his club and George elbowed him in the face, resulting in two more penalties.\\nWood saved again and Gryffindor scored. A goal from Bell made the score 50-10. Bole and Derrick winded Wood with two Bludgers to the stomach. Johnson scored the resulting penalty, and Gryffindor moved into a 70-10 lead when Alicia scored. As Harry chased the Snitch, Malfoy grabbed his Firebolt. Alicia then missed a penalty and Montague scored for Slytherin. After Johnson scored to make it 80-20 Malfoy plummeted towards the Snitch. Harry pursued him and took both hands off his broom to reach out and capture the Snitch, winning Gryffindor the Quidditch Cup.\\nThis was Wood\\'s last season. Harry wore the number seven this year.\\n\\n\\n===1994–1995 school year===\\nDue to the Triwizard Tournament being held at Hogwarts in the 1994–1995 school year, the Quidditch Cup was cancelled, and the team did not play.\\n\\n\\n===1995–1996 school year===\\nGryffindor Quidditch Captain, Angelina Johnson in possession of the Quaffle\\nDuring the 1995–1996 school year, Angelina Johnson was the Quidditch captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Due to Oliver Wood having graduated, selecting a new team player to fill his former position as Keeper involved a tough try-out. Ron Weasley was able to make the team as their new Keeper.\\nGryffindor began their season with a victory against Slytherin. Shortly after the match, Draco Malfoy insulted and provoked Fred and George Weasley and Harry Potter. Harry and George promptly attacked him, but the two of them and Fred had their broomsticks confiscated and were banned from Quidditch for life by Dolores Umbridge, then-High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, exploiting her new authority in Hogwarts and her vendetta against Harry. They were replaced by Andrew Kirke, Jack Sloper, and Ginny Weasley, respectively.\\nRon Weasley plays as Keeper during this school year\\nThe second game of the season went poorly, with Hufflepuff scoring so many goals that Ginny catching the snitch only gave them a ten-point loss. In the final game of the season against Ravenclaw, Ron finally managed to pull himself together as Keeper, and Ginny Weasley beat Cho Chang in the race for the Snitch. Gryffindor won the match and the Quidditch Cup.\\nFollowing Umbridge\\'s removal from the school, Harry\\'s, Fred\\'s and George\\'s bans were lifted, so Harry could play again in the next year at school.\\n\\n\\n===1996–1997 school year===\\n1996 tryouts under the captaincy of Harry Potter\\nHarry Potter was appointed as the Quidditch Captain during the 1996–1997 school year. The tryouts lasted two hours and involved many complaints and several tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet 260 and several broken teeth. Many first years tried out (who clearly had never flown before) and in addition, some of the people trying out were from Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. Katie Bell warned Harry not to be biased for tryouts, such as keeping old players or letting friends in, which were mistakes that led good Quidditch teams being ruined.\\nThere was a group of girls involving Romilda Vane who tried out but just giggled and fell over each other when Harry blew the whistle. Another group had a pileup halfway around the pitch, and the fourth group came without broomsticks. Ginny Weasley and Demelza Robins replaced Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet and joining Katie Bell, the only person (along with Harry) from the original Quidditch team Harry was in during his first year, as Chasers. For Beaters, Jimmy Peakes and Ritchie Coote were eventually chosen, and Ron was chosen as Keeper.\\nThe Gryffindor Quidditch team in the 1996–1997 school year\\nRon Weasley and Katie Bell both became unintended victims of Draco Malfoy\\'s attempts to kill Albus Dumbledore this year, and while they were unable to play, their spots in the team were taken over by Cormac McLaggen and Dean Thomas. After they were healed they both returned to the team. Harry missed the season\\'s last game due to detention with Professor Snape.\\nTherefore, for that final match, Ginny Weasley played as Seeker, and her position as a Chaser was taken over once again by Dean Thomas. Gryffindor won the Quidditch Cup for the second year in a row.\\n\\n\\n===1997–1998 school year===\\nIt is unknown if the cup was played for in the 1997–1998 school year, what would have been Harry\\'s last school year. It is unlikely, however, that the Quidditch cup was played for as Snape is quoted as \"\\'\\'Bringing back Umbridge\\'s old rules.\\'\\'\"\\n\\n\\n==Annual fixtures==\\n:1st match: Slytherin - Gryffindor\\n::First/second weekend in November\\n:2nd match: Gryffindor - Hufflepuff\\n::First/second weekend in March\\n:3rd match: Ravenclaw - Gryffindor\\n\\n\\n==Uniform and equipment==\\nThe Gryffindor Quidditch team\\'s uniforms are red and gold like their house colours.\\nFor Beaters, they also carry small black clubs (similar to baseball bats) to help them ward off Bludgers during matches.

Only one Quidditch Captain exists in a House at a time.\\nUnlike prefects being firmly chosen from only the fifth year students and above of each house, the exact requirement and restriction for choosing team captains is unknown, seeing as captains of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Oliver Wood was appointed in either his fourth year or fifth year, Angelina Johnson in her seventh year, and Harry Potter in his sixth year, thus an age requirement might not have existed. It is however proven that Quidditch captaincy is not a simple matter of seniority on the team, as shown in the case of Harry Potter being made captain, while a member of his team, Katie Bell, was a year older than him.\\n\\n\\n===Role===\\nQuidditch Captain Harry Potter supervising house tryouts\\nWhen a Quidditch team member is appointed as Captain, they will retain their previous position (either Beater, Chaser, Keeper or Seeker) as well as assuming their additional responsibilities: Being required to hold Quidditch trials, plan training sessions and organise their House teams, and also responsible for almost anything regarding their House team activities and members.\\nCaptains are given status similarly equal to that of prefects, being given a silver badge to wear on their school uniform or on their Quidditch robes during matches or practising, and are allowed to use the Prefects\\' Bathroom.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Cormac McLaggen was a British wizard and member of the McLaggen family, a family known for being \"\\'\\'big in the Ministry\\'\\'\". He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1990 to 1997. He was Sorted into Gryffindor house and was one year above the famous Harry Potter.\\nMcLaggen lost the opportunity to try out for his house\\'s Quidditch team in his sixth year after he ate poisonous Doxy eggs on a bet, but became the reserve Keeper in his seventh year. During the course of his last year at Hogwarts, he also became a member of the Slug Club, escorted Hermione Granger to the club\\'s Christmas party, and was primarily responsible for the Gryffindor Quidditch team\\'s embarrassing loss to Hufflepuff by hitting Harry Potter (seeker at the time) over the head with a beater\\'s bat.\\nLike most Gryffindor students, McLaggen participated in the final battle of the Second Wizarding War and fought alongside the defenders of Hogwarts. McLaggen survived the battle, it is currently unknown what happened to McLaggen after the war.\\n\\n\\n===Early life===\\nLittle is known of McLaggen\\'s early life, though it appears that he was born into a relatively influential wizarding family, as his uncle Tiberius was an important official in the Ministry of Magic and was friendly with the head of the Auror Office and later Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour. Tiberius took his nephew hunting Nogtails on at least one occasion, with Scrimgeour and Bertie Higgs in Norfolk.\\n\\n\\n====Early years====\\nCormac McLaggen started his education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1990 and was Sorted into Gryffindor, along with Katie Bell who also was a Sorted Gryffindor that year. Cormac was a skilled flyer on a broom and Quidditch player, specifically playing the position of Keeper.\\n\\n\\n====Sixth year====\\nMcLaggen at the Keeper try-outs standing next to Ron Weasley\\nIn 1995–1996 school year, McLaggen\\'s sixth year at Hogwarts, he ate a pound of poisonous Doxy eggs on a bet to prove his bravery. This foolhardy decision kept him from joining the Gryffindor Quidditch team, something he cared a great deal about. With Oliver Wood\\'s graduation at the end of the 1993–1994 school year and the Triwizard Tournament cancelling all Quidditch matches the following year, the Gryffindor team was in need of a Keeper at the beginning of the 1995–1996 school year. Unfortunately for McLaggen, he was in the Hospital Wing being treated for doxy egg poisoning at the time of the trials, and Ron Weasley was made Keeper instead.\\n\\n\\n====Seventh year====\\nThe following year, McLaggen\\'s last, he met Professor Horace Slughorn on the Hogwarts Express. Because of his well-connected uncle Tiberius, McLaggen was invited to be a member of the Slug Club.\\nMcLaggen attending a Slug Club dinner party\\nSoon after his seventh year began, McLaggen tried out for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, but he managed to make only four out of five saves. This was because Hermione Granger, who overheard McLaggen making rude remarks about Ron and Ginny Weasley, had dishonestly placed a Confundus Charm on him. McLaggen angrily asked team captain Harry Potter for another try, but Harry refused, and Ron was given the position of Keeper again, as he beat McLaggen in saves.\\nIn December, McLaggen attended Professor Slughorn\\'s Christmas party with Hermione, who was also a member of the Slug Club. The evening did not go well for him, however, as Hermione only asked him out to get back at Ron dating Lavender Brown to spite her. McLaggen ended up driving her crazy by talking about himself excessively, boasting about his Quidditch abilities, and being too forward romantically. She avoided him for most of the night to talk to Harry and Luna Lovegood. McLaggen asked Harry if he had seen her later, which Harry denied, and was irritated to find that she had left. After eating a foul tasting dragon tartare, McLaggen vomited on Severus Snape\\'s shoes, earning himself detention for the next month.\\nMcLaggen playing Keeper for Gryffindor after Ron Weasley is poisoned by Draco Malfoy\\nWhen Ron was hospitalised in March, before Gryffindor\\'s second game against Hufflepuff, Harry Potter was forced to play McLaggen as his reserve Keeper. In the week leading up to the match, Harry had his doubts about his new team-mate. Although he was skilled, McLaggen was also bossy and repeatedly tried to advise Harry on game strategy and insulted the other players\\' abilities. The match was a no-holds-barred disaster, as McLaggen spent much more time trying to tell the rest of the team how to play rather than watching the rings, resulting in several goals for the opponent. This culminated in him wrestling a Beater\\'s bat\\xa0away from Jimmy Peakes and attempting to show him how to hit a Bludger, only to knock Harry off his broomstick and crack his skull.\\nThe fiasco was possibly Gryffindor\\'s worst and most embarrassing loss ever (a final score of 320-60), and Ron told Harry in the Hospital Wing that he thought McLaggen\\'s enraged teammates \\'\\'\"might\\'ve dealt with him before you get out of here...\"\\'\\' When Ron recovered, he resumed the Keeper position while Cormac was permanently removed from the team.\\n\\n\\n====Repeat year====\\nCormac and other students are meet by Death Eaters\\nCormac was forced to repeat his final year. When the Death Eaters boarded the train, he foolishly stated that his father would hear about this, but the Death Eaters completely ignored him. \\nCormac joined the revived Dumbledore\\'s Army to oppose the Death Eater teachers Alecto and Amycus Carrow. He later fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and survived the battle.\\n\\n\\n==Physical appearance==\\nMcLaggen was described as a large, wire-haired youth. His face went red whenever he became angry. At the Keeper tryouts in 1996, Harry Potter thought that McLaggen was large enough that he could block all three goal hoops without even moving.\\n\\n\\n==Personality and traits==\\nCormac attempting to intimidate Ron Weasley\\nAggressive, arrogant, and self-righteous, McLaggen epitomised the most negative aspects of the stereotypical Gryffindor characteristics. Though brave, he was foolhardy rather than self-sacrificing. He was also arrogant and pushy and felt a strong sense of entitlement. According to Hermione Granger, McLaggen was rude, insensitive, and over-assertive when making romantic advances. All he did was talk about himself and lacked manners and consideration of others. It was due to this that Hermione remarked that Grawp (Hagrid\\'s giant half-brother) was more mannered than Cormac. \\nMcLaggen also had a bad temper; for example, Harry Potter thought he might punch him for refusing his demand to give him another Quidditch tryout. He also blamed others, doing so with Ginny Weasley for not properly shooting at her brother Ron during Keeper tryouts. When Harry was forced to put McLaggen on the team as a substitute Keeper, McLaggen proved to be a poor team player and a poor Keeper overall. He spent much more time in the match offering unwanted observations of others rather than concentrating on what he was meant to be doing in the game.\\nRegardless of his negative traits, Cormac proved himself quite brave and righteous, willingly joining his allies in the Battle of Hogwarts despite having no obligation to do so, and actually acting as one of the leaders of Dumbledore\\'s Army during Lord Voldemort\\'s reign over Hogwarts, alongside Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood.\\n\\n\\n==Magical abilities and skills==\\nMcLaggen playing as Keeper during a Quidditch match\\n*Flying: Cormac was a very accomplished and talented broomstick flyer, and he joined the Gryffindor Quidditch team as a reserve Keeper in his seventh year, showing his impressive Quidditch skills. \\n*Duelling: Cormac was a very skilled duellist, as he bravely fought in the Battle of Hogwarts against the Death Eaters, and survived. He would have had to have been very proficient with Martial magic to have survived such a bloody and violent conflict.\\n\\n\\n===Hermione Granger===\\nHermione Granger, whom he was infatuated with\\nIn his seventh year, McLaggen became familiar with Hermione Granger when they were both members of the Slug Club. Hermione seemed to think that McLaggen was arrogant and unpleasant, and when she overheard him insult Ron and Ginny Weasley during Quidditch try-outs, she hit him with a Confundus Charm, unbeknownst to him.\\nHowever, when Hermione and Ron later had a row over Ron’s romance with Lavender Brown, she tried to make him jealous by asking McLaggen to attend Professor Slughorn’s Christmas party with her, choosing the person she thought would annoy Ron the most. He accepted, but spent most of the evening boasting about himself, to her irritation. He was very forward with her under the mistletoe, prompting Hermione to abandon him to seek out Harry Potter and Luna Lovegood and to avoid him for the rest of the party. He was very annoyed when he was unable to find her. This indicates that while McLaggen was romantically interested in Hermione, she found him to be a rude braggart.\\n\\n\\n===Harry Potter===\\nAlthough they were in the same House, Harry strongly disliked McLaggen. The two first met in 1996 when they were both questioned by Professor Slughorn. They met again when McLaggen tried out for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, of which Harry was the Captain. It seemed that McLaggen wrongly expected preferential treatment from Harry because the two were both in the Slug Club.\\nWhen Ron Weasley beat McLaggen in saves, he accused Ginny Weasley of purposely giving her brother an advantage. He angrily confronted Harry about it, who coldly refuted the accusations. Harry thought that McLaggen might punch him for a moment. Later in the year, when McLaggen temporarily replaced Ron, he annoyed Harry immensely by repeatedly offering advice on game strategy, and spent so much time ordering around his team-mates and knocking Harry out instead of blocking goals that Gryffindor ultimately lost the match.\\nCormac also disliked Harry because he was best friends with Hermione Granger (whom Cormac fancied). Cormac and Harry also seemed to both represent different aspects of Gryffindor: with Cormac personifying the negative traits such as arrogance and self-righteousness, while Harry embodied the positive traits of chivalry, courage, and having a self-sacrificing nature. However, they both seemed to have nasty tempers.\\n\\n\\n===Ron Weasley===\\nMcLaggen and Ron Weasley took an instant dislike to one another in 1996, when they competed over the Keeper position on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. McLaggen believed that the team Captain, Harry Potter, showed favouritism toward his friend, whereas Harry thought Ron was simply the better player and that McLaggen was far too arrogant to make a decent player.\\nRon’s dislike of McLaggen prompted Hermione Granger to ask him to escort her to Professor Slughorn’s Christmas party, which he did, much to Ron’s displeasure. He was further annoyed when McLaggen took over his position as Keeper after he was poisoned, and relieved when it did not go well.\\n\\n\\n==Etymology==\\nThe name \\'\\'Cormac\\'\\' is borne by a number of figures from Irish legend and history, including Cormac mac Airt, a warrior king of Ireland, and Cormac Cond Longas, an exiled prince of Ulster. The name is most commonly translated as \"charioteer\", but can be also translated into \"raven\"- a bird strongly associated with warfare in Celtic mythology. This may allude to McLaggen\\'s aggressive personality. The name can also be translated to mean \"son of defilement\", from the Gaelic \\'\\'corb\\'\\', \"defilement\", and \\'\\'mac\\'\\', \"son\".\\n\\n\\n==Behind the scenes==\\n*Cormac McLaggen was played by Freddie Stroma in  and the two-part film adaptation of .\\n*In , Cormac is seen on the Hogwarts Express returning to school for the 1997–1998 school year and he also appeared in the Room of Requirement in , however, in the novel of , Cormac was in his seventh and final year (it wasn\\'t mentioned in the film, though). However, because he was constantly thinking up new Quidditch strategies in his final year, it\\'s possible he was doing so bad in his studies that he had to stay back a year. Another possibility is that he was returning to Hogwarts to take his N.E.W.T.S, as all examinations were cancelled in the previous year following the death of Albus Dumbledore.\\n*In the films, Cormac takes part in the Battle of Hogwarts and appears as a member of Dumbledore\\'s Army.\\n*In , Cormac is given a month of detention for throwing up on Snape\\'s shoes (an event that never occurred in the book) because Harry tricked him into believing that the dragon tartare he was eating was dragon testicles, or \\'\\'\"dragon balls\"\\'\\' as Harry called them.\\n*There was a scene with Ron confronting Cormac before the Quidditch match in the film, but it was later removed. This scene was never released.\\n*It is unknown if he is in the same year as Harry in the films; it is possible albeit rather unlikely.\\n*In the film he never knocks Harry out since the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff was completely omitted.\\n*In the films, Cormac seems to be less obnoxious than in the books.\\n*Due to his joining the DA, and seemingly being a fairly reasonable character, if a bit cocky, in the films, it is rather unclear to people who haven\\'t read the books why Hermione is quite contemptuous of him and his feelings for her.\\n*In  Cormac appears in several scenes but has no speaking lines.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.9259041109473269, 'meta': {'url': 'https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Cormac_McLaggen', 'name': 'Cormac_McLaggen'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '6c58dc3db7b323e5b8acc64b18148728'}>,\n",

During her Hogwarts years, she became close friends with Hermione Granger, Cho Chang, Katie Bell, and Angelina Johnson. In her seventh year, she joined Dumbledore\\'s Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter. In 1998, she returned at Hogwarts in order to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters.\\nIt can be assumed that Alicia survived the final battle of the Second Wizarding War since she was not listed amongst the casualties. What she did in her later life is currently unknown.\\n\\n\\n===Early life===\\nAlicia was born in 1977\\xa0or 1978\\xa0in Great Britain.\\n\\n\\n====Early years====\\nAlicia Spinnet attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1989 to 1996, and was sorted into Gryffindor House. There, she became best friends with fellow Gryffindors Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson, Lee Jordan, Oliver Wood, and the twins Fred and George Weasley who all shared an interest in Quidditch.\\nAlicia tried out for the Gryffindor Quidditch team and made reserve position; according to a comment by Lee Jordan, she was a good pick by Oliver, meaning she had an impressive skill at Quidditch but still only made reserve.\\n\\n\\n====Third year====\\nAlicia standing with the rest of the Gryffindor team before a Quidditch game\\nAlicia was only a reserve on the Gryffindor Quidditch team until 1991, her third year, when she would become a Chaser. Alicia was most often the Chaser who attempts penalty shots for Gryffindor when the other team commits a foul. In 1991, a new Seeker, Harry Potter, joined the team. Alicia became friendly with Harry, too. The Gryffindor Quidditch team won two times during this year, but was defeated by Ravenclaw, costing them their chance at the title. However, Gryffindor House would have had the most points by the end of the year, due to Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Neville Longbottom because of their actions the previous night.\\n\\n\\n====Fourth year====\\nAlicia is present when Draco Malfoy calls Hermione Granger a \"\\'\\'filthy little Mudblood\\'\\'\"\\nAlicia found prejudice based on blood purity extremely offensive, screaming \"how dare you\" when Draco Malfoy called Hermione Granger a \"Mudblood\" in 1992. The Quidditch matches were cancelled in 1992 due to the attacks on the muggle-born students by the Basilisk.\\nHowever, the team had time to play against Slytherin; during the game, a Rogue bludger chased Harry in an unusual way. Alicia was afraid that the Bludger would kill Harry as it was very violent, and told Oliver Wood, the Captain, that they should ask to forfeit the match.\\nKatie, Angelina, and Alicia at the only meeting of the Duelling club after catching Lockhart\\'s cloak\\nDuring this year, she also was a member of the Duelling Club and she attended the first meeting with Katie and Angelina. At the Duelling Club, the three of them fought for Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s cloak that he tossed into the crowd before duelling with Snape. Later during the club meeting she witnessed Harry Potter speak Parseltongue in order to save a fellow student from a snake that Draco Malfoy conjured during his practise duel with him. It is unknown if she was one of the many students who thought that Harry himself was the Heir of Slytherin.\\n\\n\\n====Fifth year====\\nProfessor McGonagall and the residents of Gryffindor Tower\\xa0in the common room after Sirius Black\\'s break-in\\nIn Alicia\\'s fifth year, Wood became more competitive, as Gryffindor had not won the Quidditch Cup in over seven years and he wanted to break the losing streak. During practise, Wood commented on his chasers playing \"superbly\". Gryffindor had originally planned to play Slytherin first, but due to Draco\\'s injury, they faced the\\xa0Hufflepuff team\\xa0instead, captained by\\xa0Cedric Diggory. When Wood spoke of the Hufflepuff Captain Cedric, Katie, Angelina, and Alicia started giggling and commented on Cedric\\'s good looks. The game itself did not go too well, as the players struggled against the terrible weather, and Harry, Gryffindor\\'s Seeker, had passed out in the presence of a Dementor\\xa0and fell from his broom, leaving Cedric to catch the Snitch and Gryffindor to lose the match. Alicia was also present the night that Sirius Black successfully broke into Gryffindor Tower.\\nGryffindor wins the\\xa0Quidditch Cup\\xa0in 1994\\nAlicia and her team later played\\xa0Ravenclaw. Gryffindor were up by eighty points when Ravenclaw started to make a comeback, but Harry caught the Snitch. The final match of the season was against Slytherin and the match was loaded with brutal play. Gryffindor won the match and the Quidditch Cup something that hadn\\'t been achieved since Charlie Weasley played on the team. At the end of Alicia\\'s fifth year, she and her fellow players would bid farewell to Wood as he graduated from Hogwarts. She was also present when the Dementors were removed from school grounds.\\n\\n\\n====Sixth year====\\nDuring her sixth year, the Quidditch matches were cancelled again, due to the Triwizard Tournament. Despite being in the sixth year, it is unknown whether Alicia was old enough to enter her name into the Goblet of Fire. However, the year ended with the death of champion Cedric Diggory and the return of Lord Voldemort.\\n\\n\\n====Seventh year====\\nDuring her seventh and final year Alicia was captained under Angelina Johnson, who replaced Oliver Wood when he left. The team\\'s first Quidditch practise did not very well and resulted in Katie Bell suffering great blood loss. When High Inquisitor Dolores Umbridge inspected Filius Flitwick classes, she asked her how she viewed Flitwick\\'s skills as teacher, and she responded only with positive comments. Disliking Umbridge, Alicia and her friends met up for the meeting at Hog\\'s Head and would then join Dumbledore\\'s Army, an organisation founded by Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger and led by Harry, in order to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts to the students, something that Umbridge did not.\\nAlicia attended as many meetings as she could make without being caught by Umbridge and risking being in detention as the meetings themselves were cutting into what little Quidditch practise she had and she couldn\\'t afford to lose her spare time. At the last meeting before Christmas break, Alicia informed Harry that she and Angelina had found replacements for the team once they had left, Ginny Weasley, Andrew Kirke, and Jack Sloper, she remarks they are not good but will do. In her first meeting, where they practised the Disarming Charm, Alicia was hit hard on the nose by Terry Boot\\'s wand when it went flying across the room.\\n\\n\\n====Battle of Hogwarts====\\nAlicia and the other defenders of Hogwarts witness Harry Potter\\'s final defeat of Voldemort\\nAfter graduating from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry it is unknown what Alicia went on to do, furthering her career in Quidditch is a possibility. But as the Second Wizarding War was at its height she carried her Dumbledore\\'s Army coin around with her, and when the time came in 1998, Neville Longbottom summoned all past and present D.A. members to return to Hogwarts to join the forces in the Battle of Hogwarts fighting against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Alicia returned to Hogwarts with her friends, Oliver Wood, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson and Order of the Phoenix members they informed, Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour.\\n\\n\\n===Later life ===\\nIt can be assumed that she survived the final battle as she was not listed amongst the dead that Harry Potter recognised, nor was her name among the Fallen Fifty. If she survived the battle, her life after the war is unknown.\\n\\n\\n==Personality and traits==\\nAlicia was\\xa0a good-natured and friendly individual\\xa0who was\\xa0very interested in Quidditch. She did\\xa0also care about her friends, as she was afraid for\\xa0Harry Potter\\'s life while a bludger was chasing him. Furthermore, she strongly disliked\\xa0those with pure-blood supremacist views, such as Draco Malfoy, and believed\\xa0that\\xa0no differences exist\\xa0between pure-bloods and muggle-borns, as she screamed to Malfoy \\'\\'\"How dare you!\"\\'\\', when he called Hermione Granger a \\'\\'\"mudblood\"\\'\\'. She was also brave, as she was sorted at Gryffindor house, and was a member of Dumbledore\\'s Army in order to oppose\\xa0Dolores Umbridge. Furthermore, she fought at the Battle of Hogwarts in order to help defeat the Death Eaters and win the final battle, showing her to be very courageous and determined\\xa0indeed.\\xa0\\nAlicia playing Quidditch with Fred and George\\n\\n\\n==Magical abilities and skills==\\n*Flying: Alicia played the position of Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, showing she was an excellent broomstick\\xa0flyer\\xa0and Quidditch\\xa0player. She often took the penalty shots for the team.\\n*Duelling:  Alicia learned how to duel at the Duelling Club in her fourth year. She was also taught both defensive and offensive spells by Harry Potter, while attending meetings of Dumbledore\\'s Army. She later bravely fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and very likely survived, showing her to have been a highly skilful duellist who was proficient with martial magic.\\n*Charms: Alicia was apparently highly talented and proficient with charms, as she took the subject to N.E.W.T.-level, meaning she must have achieved either an \"Outstanding\" or \"Exceeds Expectations\" at Ordinary Wizarding Level.\\n\\n\\n===Gryffindor Quidditch team===\\nThe Gryffindor Quidditch team in 1991\\nAlicia was a member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, during her years at Hogwarts. There, she became best friends with fellow members Angelina Johnson, with whom she possibly shared a dormitory, and Katie Bell, who was a year younger than her. Alicia, Angelina and Katie were also the only girls at the team.\\nShe was also a good friend of the twins Fred and George Weasley. Fred and George liked doing pranks and teasing the others, but defended their friends. When Fred and George were kicked off from the team by Dolores Umbridge, Alicia was very angry with them, as their loss at the team would cost them the Quidditch cup.\\nAnother friend of hers was Lee Jordan. Although he wasn\\'t a member of the team, he was the Quidditch matches commentator, and strongly supported the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Lee liked doing pranks, too.\\nAlicia was also a close friend of Oliver Wood, the Captain of the team. However, they argued several times, as in 1992; Alicia shouted at Oliver, when he wanted Harry to keep on playing, while a Bludger was chasing him. Oliver had been very proud of the team by the end of the year; the year that they eventually won the Quidditch cup.\\nOther members of the team were Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. Harry, the Seeker, was extremely good, but Ron had a lack of confidence, due to the Slytherins making fun of him. Eventually, Ron was proved to be very good, as the members of the team, including Alicia, supported him and advised him not to be bothered by the Slytherins.\\nAlicia seemed to care about Harry, as he was her friend, and she thought he shouldn\\'t keep on playing in 1992, while a Bludger was chasing him. She also went as far as to kiss Harry after he won them a match against Ravenclaw (along with Angelina and Katie). Alicia also became a member of Dumbledore\\'s Army, in order to be taught Defence Against the Dark Arts by Harry, and she later fought at the Battle of Hogwarts, alongside Harry and the other members of the team.\\n\\n\\n===Dumbledore\\'s Army===\\nAlicia became a member of Dumbledore\\'s Army in her seventh year. It was an organisation founded by Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and led by Harry, in order to teach the members Defence Against the Dark Arts, something that professor Dolores Umbridge did not. Furthermore, they wanted to oppose Umbridge. Alicia was rather friendly with the most of them.\\nShe appeared to be a close friend of Hermione Granger, a Gryffindor girl two years younger than her. Alicia defended Hermione when Draco Malfoy insulted her. When Malfoy called Hermione a “mudblood”, Alicia screamed “HOW DARE YOU!” to Malfoy. Alicia and Hermione fought together at the Battle of Hogwarts.\\nAlicia would have been on good terms with fellow Gryffindors Neville Longbottom, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, Lavender Brown, Parvati Patil, Colin and Dennis Creevey. Other members of the army were Justin Finch-Fletchley, Susan Bones, Terry Boot, Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, Zacharias Smith, Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Cho Chang, Padma Patil, Marietta Edgecombe and Luna Lovegood. Alicia would have disliked Marietta Edgecombe, who betrayed the army to Umbridge, and Zacharias Smith, who abandoned the army during the Battle of Hogwarts.\\n\\n\\n==Behind the scenes==\\n*Alicia Spinnet\\'s ethnicity is unknown as it was never clearly described or stated in the books.\\n*Alicia Spinnet was portrayed by Leilah Sutherland in \\'\\'Harry Potter and the Philosopher\\'s Stone\\'\\' and by Rochelle Douglas for \\'\\'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\'\\'. If Alicia appeared in latter films, none of the actresses or extras were credited. \\n*None of the actresses who previously portrayed Alicia have been asked to reprise the role for any of the other films, nor have any new ones been recast. She did not appear in the Battle of Hogwarts scene in the \\'\\'Deathly Hallows\\'\\' film.\\n*Out of the three Chasers who played for Gryffindor during Harry\\'s first five years at Hogwarts, Alicia is the only one to not be injured during a Quidditch match in any of the films (Angelina crashed into the stands in \\'\\'Philosopher\\'s Stone\\'\\' and Katie\\'s broom caught fire in \\'\\'Prisoner of Azkaban\\'\\'). She is also the only member of the original Gryffindor team to never have a speaking role in any of the films.\\n\\n\\n==Etymology==\\nAlicia is related to Alice and ultimately the German Adalheid, meaning \"noble type (of person) also kind and beauty.\" The last name really exists and is often spelled Spinnett. A spinet a small upright piano. Alicia\\'s name also may be a variation of spinner or spinney, a small grove of trees.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.9255934414762682, 'meta': {'url': 'https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Alicia_Spinnet', 'name': 'Alicia_Spinnet'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'fc7181e08b4d1a20eb623acee3568971'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Marcus Flint (b. 1975/1976) was a wizard who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1987 to 1994 and was sorted into Slytherin house. He was a Chaser on the Slytherin Quidditch team, as well as its Captain from at least 1991 to 1994. \\n\\n\\n===Early life===\\nMarcus was born in September 1975 to August 1976 in Great Britain. He was a descendant of the pure-blood Flint family and perhaps related in some way to former Minister for Magic, Josephina Flint and Ursula Black (née Flint). It is unknown if Marcus himself was a pure-blood.\\n\\n\\n====Early years====\\nMarcus and other Slytherins playing a game of Quidditch\\nFlint began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1987 and was Sorted into Slytherin House. He lived in a dormitory in the Slytherin Dungeon, and his Head of House was the Potions Master, Professor Severus Snape.\\nAt some point, he joined the Slytherin Quidditch team as a Chaser and became its captain by his fifth year. Flint was known for being very rough and often brutal in his Quidditch-playing; for example, his handshakes with Gryffindor Captain and rival Oliver Wood often turned into attempts to break one another\\'s fingers. He was also not above committing fouls, blocking Harry Potter in a 1991 Quidditch match.\\n\\n\\n====Sixth year====\\nIn 1992, Flint was pleased when his team received new broomsticks, courtesy of Lucius Malfoy, when his son Draco became the team\\'s new Seeker. They bragged to the Gryffindor Quidditch team about this and mocked their rivals\\' older brooms. This prompted Hermione Granger to insult Draco, remarking that \"\\'\\'at least no one on the Gryffindor team had to \\'\\'buy\\'\\' their way in\\'\\'\". Draco retaliated by calling Hermione a \"\\'\\'filthy little Mudblood\\'\\'\" to the outrage of the Gryffindors. Flint had to stand in front of Draco to prevent Fred and George Weasley from attacking and injuring his Seeker. Ron Weasley then attempted to curse Draco, but it backfired, and the entire Slytherin team laughed uproariously as Ron vomited slugs. \\nFlint was angered by Draco\\'s stupidity during a match against Gryffindor. He reprimanded him after the game because Draco failed to notice the Golden Snitch next to him, causing Slytherin to lose the match. This was witnessed by George Weasley.\\n\\n\\n====Seventh year====\\nDuring Flint\\'s final year, he participated in a scheme to scare Harry Potter with Draco, Vincent Crabbe, and Gregory Goyle. The four Slytherins dressed up as Dementors, which were guarding Hogwarts that year due to Sirius Black\\'s escape from Azkaban. Following their cruel prank, Professor Minerva McGonagall took fifty House points from Slytherin and sentenced all four of them to detention as punishment. During the Quidditch final between Gryffindor and Slytherin that year, Flint played unscrupulously yet again against the rival team, smashing into Angelina Johnson with his broom, which resulted in Fred Weasley throwing his Beater\\'s bat at his head, smashing his nose against his broom handle and causing it to bleed. Flint later managed during the game to score a goal against Gryffindor, but Harry caught the Golden Snitch, allowing Gryffindor to win the game and to gain the Quidditch Cup at last.\\n\\n\\n===Later Life===\\nIt is unknown what happened to Flint after he graduated Hogwarts and what his status was during the Second Wizarding War.\\nDuring the 2010s, Flint\\'s younger self appeared as a Foundable during the Calamity, clad in his Slytherin Quidditch uniform and entrapped by a magical fire Confoundable. Volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force were able to free him by casting the Water-Making Spell, allowing Flint to return to his original time.\\n\\n\\n==Physical appearance==\\nFlint\\'s unappealing physical appearance\\nMarcus was described as being tall and relatively muscular. Harry Potter also mentioned that he looked like he might have troll blood in him. However, this may simply have been an insult toward Flint\\'s appearance.\\n\\n\\n==Personality and traits==\\nFlint did not follow good sportsmanship when playing Quidditch, despite his position as Captain of his team. He allowed Draco Malfoy to join the team when bribed with the new Nimbus 2001 broomsticks. Flint also resorted frequently to foul play, such as blocking Harry Potter in 1991 and trying to scare him by disguising as a Dementor in 1993. He seemed to find the misfortunes of others amusing as he laughed when Ron\\'s Slug-vomiting Charm backfired on himself. When Draco failed to notice the Snitch floating above his head, leading the team to lose, Flint yelled at the new Seeker rather harshly for his foolishness. It was unknown how he viewed the importance of blood status, though he seemed to approve of when Draco called Hermione a mudblood and even defended him from harm afterwards, implying he may have held some prejudice towards Muggle-borns or that he was a pure-blood supremacist, similar to many other Slytherin students.\\n\\n\\n==Magical abilities and skills==\\n*Flying: Marcus played as a Chaser on the Slytherin Quidditch team. He was the Captain from at least his fifth year to his seventh year, demonstrating he was an accomplished and skilled broomstick flyer and Quidditch player, despite his frequent cheating and foul play on the Quidditch pitch.\\n\\n\\n==Etymology==\\n*The name Marcus is derived from Mars, the god of war in Roman mythology. This may allude to Flint\\'s aggression. It is interestingly the opposite of Oliver Wood\\'s name, which means \"olive tree\", ultimately symbolising Wood\\'s peaceful nature. \\n*A flint is a stone used for lighting a fire. Once again, this alludes to his relationship with Oliver Wood; flint is kindling fire, and wood burns when in contact with fire.\\n\\n\\n==Behind the scenes==\\nMarcus as a LEGO minifigure (first edition)\\nMarcus Flint as a LEGO mini-figure (second edition)\\n*Flint was originally stated to be a sixth-year in , yet he was still at the school in  (two years after his debut). J. K. Rowling explained this by saying that he had to repeat his last year because he failed his exams the first time round. This explanation did not deter some fans from noticing other consistency errors with Flint\\'s schooling years. However, in later editions of , Flint is stated to be a fifth year, presumably to clear confusion and the need for a repeated year.\\n*Flint was portrayed by Will Theakston in the first film and Jamie Yeates in the second film, and both wore a set of false teeth for the role.\\n*Flint once borrowed  from the Hogwarts Library and was due to return the book on 22 June.\\n*If Stan Shunpike attended Hogwarts, he would have been in the same year as Marcus Flint.\\n*In , Marcus Flint is the Slytherin team\\'s Seeker.\\n*He was referred to as \"Captain Flint\" because he was captain of the Slytherin Quidditch Team. This may be an allusion to the similarly-named captain of the pirate ship \\'\\'Walrus\\'\\' from Robert Louis Stevenson\\'s novel \\'\\'Treasure Island\\'\\'.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.9247409860462622, 'meta': {'url': 'https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Marcus_Flint', 'name': 'Marcus_Flint'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd0f07a85e530f14ce196c7d80c7a84a6'}>],\n",
