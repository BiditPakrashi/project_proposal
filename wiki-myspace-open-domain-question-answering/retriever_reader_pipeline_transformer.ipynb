       " 'documents': [<Document: {'content': 'Gryffindor Seeker Harry Potter chasing the Golden Snitch\\nSeeker is a position in the wizarding sport of Quidditch. There is one Seeker per team. The goal of the Seeker is to catch the Golden Snitch. They play a crucial role in Quidditch, as a game does not end until the Seeker catches the Snitch. A team whose Seeker catches the Snitch receives 150 points, which almost always wins the match for that team.\\n\\n\\n==History==\\nAn old game of Quidditch depicting a Seeker and a Golden Snitch\\nThe position of the Seeker, known as the \\'\\'Hunter\\'\\', was introduced in response to Barberus Bragge\\'s introduction of the Golden Snidget during a match in 1269 making it the newest position in the game.\\nThe 1269 game mentioned above was attended by Barberus Bragge, the Chief of the Wizards\\' Council. As a nod to the sport of Snidget-hunting, which was also popular at the time, Bragge brought such a bird to the game and released it from its cage. He told the players that one-hundred fifty Galleons — a large sum of money, particularly in those times — would be awarded to the player who caught the bird.\\nThis was easier said than done: the Snidget is very fast, very small, and can make sudden changes of direction at high speeds. The considerable challenge posed by the flight patterns of the bird is what made Snidget-hunting so popular in the first place.\\nWhat happened at the Quidditch game in question was rather predictable: the players totally ignored the game, and each and every one simply went off in pursuit of the Snidget, which was kept within the arena by the crowd using Repelling Charms.\\nA witch named Modesty Rabnott, who was also watching the game, took pity on the Snidget and rescued it with a Summoning Charm before rushing away with it hidden inside her robes. She was caught by a furious Bragge and fined ten Galleons for disrupting the game, but not before she had released the Snidget. This saved the life of this bird, but the connection with Quidditch had been made, and soon a Snidget was being released at every game. Each team had an extra player — originally called the \\'\\'Hunter\\'\\', later the Seeker — whose sole job was to catch and kill the Snidget, for which one-hundred fifty points were awarded in memory of the one-hundred fifty Galleons offered by Bragge in the original game.\\nThe quickly declining number of Snidgets led to a substitute for the bird, hence the Golden Snitch came into play, and the position was given the name Seeker instead of Hunter.\\nRegulus Black\\xa0was the Seeker of his\\xa0Slytherin Quidditch team, because of his position in the team photograph — middle, front row.\\nCharlie Weasley\\xa0was\\xa0a Gryffindor\\xa0Seeker. Oliver Wood stated \"\\'\\'he could have played for England if he hadn\\'t gone off chasing dragons\\'\\'\".\\nHarry Potter was the youngest Seeker in a century, making the Gryffindor Quidditch team in his first year at Hogwarts.\\n\\n\\n==Traits==\\nSeekers are generally the smallest and lightest players on a team, and there is a certain glamour attached to playing as a Seeker. Generally, the Seeker is also the most fouled player on the team.\\nIn team portraits, the Seeker sits in the middle of the first row.\\n\\n\\n==Known Seekers==\\nAmerican National Quidditch team\\nAustralian National Quidditch team\\nBulgarian National Quidditch team\\nEnglish National Quidditch team\\nJapanese National Quidditch team\\nSpanish National Quidditch team\\n\\n\\n==Behind the scenes==\\n*In , Harry\\'s father, James Potter, was said to have been a Seeker.

It is currently unknown how the team performed during this time period.\\nDuring the 1953–1954 school year, Minerva McGonagall had a nasty fall (a foul during the Gryffindor vs Slytherin match, which would decide the Quidditch Cup winner) that left her with a concussion, several broken ribs, and a lifelong desire to see Slytherin crushed on the Quidditch pitch.\\n\\n\\n===1960s===\\nR.

McGonagall played on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, winning an award for it in 1971. It is currently unknown how the team did during this time period.\\n\\n\\n===1980s===\\nDuring the 1985–1986 school year, Charles Weasley played as Seeker for Gryffindor, and Gryffindor won the Quidditch Cup. Gryffindor Quidditch team however failed to win the Quidditch Cup during school years of 1986–1987, 1987–1988, 1988–1989, and 1989–1990.\\n\\n\\n===1990-1991 school year===\\nAccording to Gryffindor Head of House, Minerva McGonagall, Gryffindor was \"flattened\" by Slytherin. Oliver Wood was Gryffindor\\'s Keeper and Fred and George Weasley were Beaters. Alicia Spinnet was only a reserve for Gryffindor this season.\\n\\n\\n===1991–1992 school year===\\nThe 1991 Gryffindor Quidditch team\\nWhen Harry Potter played during his first year at Hogwarts, he was the youngest player in more than a hundred years. He also had to be given special dispensation to have his own broomstick at school, (a Nimbus 2000). This was due to the fact that first years were not allowed their own brooms, most likely because of safety reasons. This broomstick was a present from the Head of Gryffindor house, Minerva McGonagall, delivered to him during breakfast in the Great Hall one morning. This was a racing broom that would come in handy regarding chasing and catching the elusive and incredibly fast Snitch. The Gryffindor Quidditch team practised three times a week under Oliver Wood\\'s very strict supervision.\\nHarry catches the Snitch, Gryffindor wins against Slytherin\\nThe opening game, Gryffindor versus Slytherin, was played on a cold November\\'s day. This was Harry Potter\\'s debut match. Angelina Johnson was first to score, shooting the Quaffle past Bletchley. The first time Harry spotted the Snitch, so did Higgs, but as Harry sped towards he was blocked by Flint. For this, Madam Hooch awarded a penalty which Alicia Spinnet scored, but the Seekers had lost sight of the Snitch. Professor Quirrell then began to magically interfere with Harry\\'s broom, but Harry was saved when Hermione Granger cast a spell to start a small fire in the stand that Quirrell was occupying. Harry regained control of his broom and caught the Snitch by accidentally swallowing it. Although Flint complained to Hooch, she judged the incident fair play and Gryffindor won the match 170-60.\\nProfessor Severus Snape refereed the Hufflepuff versus Gryffindor match. His decisions were biased in favour of Hufflepuff. Gryffindor Beater, George Weasley hit a Bludger at him. Harry caught the Snitch in record time and won the game for Gryffindor.\\nIn Harry\\'s absence at the hospital wing, Gryffindor was defeated in their final game of the season against Ravenclaw, costing them their chance at the Quidditch Cup that year.\\n\\n\\n===1992–1993 school year===\\nA team meeting involving tactics and strategies\\nWood planned to begin training before the other three sides. Unfortunately for Gryffindor, who had got up at the crack of dawn for their first training session, Slytherin had been given use of the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch by Severus Snape. Draco Malfoy the Slytherin team\\'s new Seeker called Hermione Granger a Mudblood. This happened after she insinuated that the only reason he made the team was because of his father\\'s generous donation of Nimbus 2001s. This accusation might have very well been the truth. To make matters worse Harry had to leave with Ron\\xa0after the spell Ron attempted to cast on Malfoy backfired, causing Ron to belch up slugs.\\nDuring the rainy Slytherin versus Gryffindor match, the Slytherin Chasers were dominant, taking a 60-0 lead at one point. Harry was relentlessly pursued by a rogue Bludger, so Oliver Wood called for a time-out. However, Harry agreed to play on, telling the Weasley twins to stop flying around him so he could pursue the Snitch. When the action resumed Harry was struck on the elbow by a Bludger, which broke his right arm. Despite this, when he spotted the Snitch he was able to chase after it and grasp it in his left hand, winning the match for Gryffindor. Gilderoy Lockhart then attempted to mend Harry\\'s broken arm, but instead removed the bone. Harry was given Skele-Gro in the Hospital Wing, where that night Dobby revealed it was he who had tampered with the Bludger.\\nIn anticipation of their next match against Hufflepuff, Wood insisted on Gryffindor team practises every night after dinner.\\nUnfortunately, the Quidditch Cup was completely cancelled due to attacks on Muggle-born students before the Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff match.\\n\\n\\n===1993–1994 school year===\\nIn the 1993–1994 school year, the team is said by Lee Jordan to be \"\\'\\'the best team Hogwarts has seen in the last few years\\'\\'\". This was the first year that they had won the Quidditch Cup since Charles Weasley was on the team. Gryffindor kept the same team as the previous year. It was seventeen-year-old captain Oliver Wood\\'s last season. They trained three times a week.\\nThe Slytherin versus Gryffindor match was re-scheduled as Flint claimed his Seeker, Malfoy had an injured arm, so the first match was Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff.\\nThe match right before a mass of Dementors converge on the Quidditch pitch\\nThe game was played in heavy rain, ferocious wind, thunder, and lightning. The wind was so powerful that the players staggered sideways as they walked onto the very muddy pitch. The sound of the thunder drowned out the crowd\\'s shouts. Madam Hooch\\'s whistle to start the match coincided with the first bolt of lightning. Harry\\'s vision was hindered by the constant raindrops on his glasses and he was almost struck by a Bludger twice.\\nWood called for a time-out when Gryffindor were fifty points up. Hermione Granger used \"Impervius\" so Harry\\'s glasses would repel any water. When both Seekers had spotted the Snitch, Harry then saw at least one hundred Dementors that had entered the stadium. He heard his mother\\'s last words before she was killed by Lord Voldemort and he fell about fifty feet to the ground. Albus Dumbledore ran onto the pitch waving his wand and slowing Harry\\'s fall. He then got rid of the Dementors, magicked Harry onto a stretcher and carried him to the castle floating upon it.\\nCedric caught the Snitch, giving Hufflepuff a win by 100 points. He offered a re-match, but Gryffindor accepted the defeat. Harry\\'s Nimbus 2000 was blown to the Whomping Willow which destroyed it.\\nGryffindor increased their training to five times a week (under the supervision of Madam Hooch) For a time, Harry used an old school Shooting Star as a substitute broom, but this changed when he received a Firebolt for Christmas (later revealed to be a gift from Sirius Black ordered via owl mail order).\\nGryffindor\\'s final practise before their match against Ravenclaw was their current side\\'s best ever, suggested to be the result of them being inspired by the Firebolt. Harry caught the Snitch within ten seconds of its release. The team performed their moves faultlessly and Wood had no criticisms, which Fred noted was a first.\\nHarry receives a Firebolt for Christmas that is soon confiscated by McGonagall\\nFor the game against Ravenclaw, Harry flew his new Firebolt. His opposing Seeker, fourth year Cho Chang, flew a Comet 260. In clear, cool conditions, Gryffindor took an eighty point lead, but Ravenclaw managed to claw it back to 80-30. When Harry spotted the Snitch for the third time, Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Flint walked onto the pitch, dressed as Dementors. Harry having been given anti-dementor lessons, shot his Patronus at them and then caught the Snitch. This gave Gryffindor a victory, whose fans ran onto the pitch in celebration. On the first Saturday after the Easter holidays, Gryffindor played Slytherin. Gryffindor had trained every day in preparation for the game. Slytherin were leading the Championship by exactly 200 points, meaning Gryffindor needed to win the match by 210 points to claim the Quidditch Cup.\\nThree-quarters of the crowd supported Gryffindor. Johnson scored first. Then Flint crashed into her, so Fred threw his bat at the back of Flint\\'s head which smashed into his broom handle, bloodying his nose. Penalties were given to each side. Alicia Spinnet scored and Wood saved. Bell scored another penalty after Montague grabbed her head. Flint then scored for Slytherin. Bole hit Alicia with his club and George elbowed him in the face, resulting in two more penalties.\\nWood saved again and Gryffindor scored. A goal from Bell made the score 50-10. Bole and Derrick winded Wood with two Bludgers to the stomach. Johnson scored the resulting penalty, and Gryffindor moved into a 70-10 lead when Alicia scored. As Harry chased the Snitch, Malfoy grabbed his Firebolt. Alicia then missed a penalty and Montague scored for Slytherin. After Johnson scored to make it 80-20 Malfoy plummeted towards the Snitch. Harry pursued him and took both hands off his broom to reach out and capture the Snitch, winning Gryffindor the Quidditch Cup.\\nThis was Wood\\'s last season. Harry wore the number seven this year.\\n\\n\\n===1994–1995 school year===\\nDue to the Triwizard Tournament being held at Hogwarts in the 1994–1995 school year, the Quidditch Cup was cancelled, and the team did not play.\\n\\n\\n===1995–1996 school year===\\nGryffindor Quidditch Captain, Angelina Johnson in possession of the Quaffle\\nDuring the 1995–1996 school year, Angelina Johnson was the Quidditch captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Due to Oliver Wood having graduated, selecting a new team player to fill his former position as Keeper involved a tough try-out. Ron Weasley was able to make the team as their new Keeper.\\nGryffindor began their season with a victory against Slytherin. Shortly after the match, Draco Malfoy insulted and provoked Fred and George Weasley and Harry Potter. Harry and George promptly attacked him, but the two of them and Fred had their broomsticks confiscated and were banned from Quidditch for life by Dolores Umbridge, then-High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, exploiting her new authority in Hogwarts and her vendetta against Harry. They were replaced by Andrew Kirke, Jack Sloper, and Ginny Weasley, respectively.\\nRon Weasley plays as Keeper during this school year\\nThe second game of the season went poorly, with Hufflepuff scoring so many goals that Ginny catching the snitch only gave them a ten-point loss. In the final game of the season against Ravenclaw, Ron finally managed to pull himself together as Keeper, and Ginny Weasley beat Cho Chang in the race for the Snitch. Gryffindor won the match and the Quidditch Cup.\\nFollowing Umbridge\\'s removal from the school, Harry\\'s, Fred\\'s and George\\'s bans were lifted, so Harry could play again in the next year at school.\\n\\n\\n===1996–1997 school year===\\n1996 tryouts under the captaincy of Harry Potter\\nHarry Potter was appointed as the Quidditch Captain during the 1996–1997 school year. The tryouts lasted two hours and involved many complaints and several tantrums, one involving a crashed Comet 260 and several broken teeth. Many first years tried out (who clearly had never flown before) and in addition, some of the people trying out were from Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. Katie Bell warned Harry not to be biased for tryouts, such as keeping old players or letting friends in, which were mistakes that led good Quidditch teams being ruined.\\nThere was a group of girls involving Romilda Vane who tried out but just giggled and fell over each other when Harry blew the whistle. Another group had a pileup halfway around the pitch, and the fourth group came without broomsticks. Ginny Weasley and Demelza Robins replaced Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet and joining Katie Bell, the only person (along with Harry) from the original Quidditch team Harry was in during his first year, as Chasers. For Beaters, Jimmy Peakes and Ritchie Coote were eventually chosen, and Ron was chosen as Keeper.\\nThe Gryffindor Quidditch team in the 1996–1997 school year\\nRon Weasley and Katie Bell both became unintended victims of Draco Malfoy\\'s attempts to kill Albus Dumbledore this year, and while they were unable to play, their spots in the team were taken over by Cormac McLaggen and Dean Thomas. After they were healed they both returned to the team. Harry missed the season\\'s last game due to detention with Professor Snape.\\nTherefore, for that final match, Ginny Weasley played as Seeker, and her position as a Chaser was taken over once again by Dean Thomas. Gryffindor won the Quidditch Cup for the second year in a row.\\n\\n\\n===1997–1998 school year===\\nIt is unknown if the cup was played for in the 1997–1998 school year, what would have been Harry\\'s last school year. It is unlikely, however, that the Quidditch cup was played for as Snape is quoted as \"\\'\\'Bringing back Umbridge\\'s old rules.\\'\\'\"\\n\\n\\n==Annual fixtures==\\n:1st match: Slytherin - Gryffindor\\n::First/second weekend in November\\n:2nd match: Gryffindor - Hufflepuff\\n::First/second weekend in March\\n:3rd match: Ravenclaw - Gryffindor\\n\\n\\n==Uniform and equipment==\\nThe Gryffindor Quidditch team\\'s uniforms are red and gold like their house colours.\\nFor Beaters, they also carry small black clubs (similar to baseball bats) to help them ward off Bludgers during matches.

His fellow Chasers were Graham Montague and Cassius Warrington. Peregrine Derrick and Lucian Bole were Slytherin\\'s Beaters, Malfoy was Seeker whilst Miles Bletchley kept his place as Keeper. Lee Jordan commented that the captain \"\\'\\'seems to be going for size rather than skill\\'\\'\" in the lineup.\\nThe Slytherin versus Gryffindor match was re-scheduled as Flint claimed his Seeker, Malfoy had an injured arm, so the first match was Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff.\\nSlytherin narrowly defeated Ravenclaw, a week after the start of term after the Christmas break.\\nWhen Harry spotted the Snitch for the third time, Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle and Flint walked onto the pitch, dressed as Dementors. Earlier in the year, the match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff was interrupted by real Dementors, despite Professor Dumbledore\\'s claim that they would not interrupt regular Hogwarts activities during their search for Azkaban escapee Sirius Black. Harry cast a Patronus at them and then caught the Snitch, granting not only a Gryffindor victory but costing Slytherin 50 house points as a result of the Dementor prank.\\nHarry Potter won the Inter-House Quidditch Cup for Gryffindor\\nOn the first Sunday after the Easter holidays Gryffindor played Slytherin. Slytherin were leading the Championship by 200 points, meaning Gryffindor needed to win the match by 210 points to claim the Quidditch Cup. Gryffindor\\'s Angelina Johnson scored first and Flint deliberately crashed into her, so Fred Weasley threw his Beater\\'s bat at the back of Flint\\'s head which smashed into his broom handle, bloodying his nose.\\nPenalties were given to each side. Alicia Spinnet scored and Gryffindor Keeper Oliver Wood saved. Katie Bell scored another penalty after Montague grabbed her head. Flint then scored for Slytherin. Bole hit Spinnet with his club and George Weasley elbowed him in the face, resulting in two more penalties. Oliver Wood saved again and Gryffindor scored. A goal from Katie Bell made the score 50-10. Bole and Derrick winded Wood with two Bludgers to the stomach. Johnson scored the resulting penalty, and Gryffindor moved into a 70-10 lead when Alicia Spinnet scored. As Harry Potter chased the Snitch, Malfoy grabbed his Firebolt. Alicia then missed a penalty and Montague scored for Slytherin. After Johnson scored to make it 80-20, Malfoy plummeted towards the Snitch. Harry pursued him and took both hands off his broom to reach out and capture the Snitch, winning the Quidditch Cup for Gryffindor.\\nSlytherin must have defeated Hufflepuff to go into the last game leading the championship by 200 points, considering they only narrowly defeated Ravenclaw.\\n\\n\\n===1994–1995 school year===\\nThe Quidditch Cup was cancelled this year due to the Triwizard Tournament being held at Hogwarts, much to the astonishment of many students. The announcement was made by Albus Dumbledore, headmaster at the time.\\n\\n\\n===1995–1996 school year===\\nVincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle replaced Derrick and Bole as the beaters on the 1995-1996 team. Slytherin lost their match against Gryffindor and narrowly lost to Hufflepuff. The outcome of Slytherin\\'s match against Ravenclaw is unknown.\\nAlthough Dolores Umbridge, via her position of High Inquisitor, decided to ban all unapproved teams, she immediately gave the Slytherin Quidditch team approval to play. Meanwhile, Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall had to plea with Professor Umbridge to allow the Gryffindor team to play.\\n\\n\\n===1996–1997 school year===\\nSlytherin vs. Gryffindor match in 1996, Gryffindor wins\\nVaisey replaced Adrian Pucey as a Chaser the 1996–1997 school year, Urquhart replaced Montague as both a Chaser and Captain. During their match against Gryffindor, Vaisey was not able to play due to a Bludger hitting his head during practice.\\nMalfoy ceased playing due to more important matters, though rather than outright quit the team he feigned illness in which Harper took his place as Seeker (it was implied that Malfoy even paid Harper to be the substitute). This intrigued Harry, as previously Draco suffered minor injuries yet exaggerated to ensure the entire match was postponed until the weather changes for the better.\\nDue to his other matters at hand, Draco ceased playing Quidditch altogether for the rest of the school year, and even lost interest in knowing the results, as he never watched any of the other matchups and barely bothered to mock Harry when his rival was heading to another match. They lost against Gryffindor. The outcomes of Slytherin\\'s matches against Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw are unknown. Draco\\'s absence led to a great decrease in the team\\'s efficiency, seemingly that nobody in Slytherin had talents that were able to make up for his.\\n\\n\\n===1997–1998 school year===\\nIt is unknown whether or not the Quidditch Cup was played during this year. If it was, Malfoy would not have remained a Seeker, due to his involvement with the Death Eaters.\\n\\n\\n==Annual fixtures==\\n:First match: Gryffindor - Slytherin\\n::First/second weekend in November\\n:Second match: Ravenclaw - Slytherin\\n::Third/fourth weekend in February\\n:Third Match: Hufflepuff - Slytherin\\n\\n\\n==Uniforms and equipment==\\nThe Slytherin Quidditch team\\'s uniforms are green and silver, representing their house colours.

       "  <Document: {'content': 'Cormac McLaggen was a British wizard and member of the McLaggen family, a family known for being \"\\'\\'big in the Ministry\\'\\'\". He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1990 to 1997. He was Sorted into Gryffindor house and was one year above the famous Harry Potter.\\nMcLaggen lost the opportunity to try out for his house\\'s Quidditch team in his sixth year after he ate poisonous Doxy eggs on a bet, but became the reserve Keeper in his seventh year. During the course of his last year at Hogwarts, he also became a member of the Slug Club, escorted Hermione Granger to the club\\'s Christmas party, and was primarily responsible for the Gryffindor Quidditch team\\'s embarrassing loss to Hufflepuff by hitting Harry Potter (seeker at the time) over the head with a beater\\'s bat.\\nLike most Gryffindor students, McLaggen participated in the final battle of the Second Wizarding War and fought alongside the defenders of Hogwarts. McLaggen survived the battle, it is currently unknown what happened to McLaggen after the war.\\n\\n\\n===Early life===\\nLittle is known of McLaggen\\'s early life, though it appears that he was born into a relatively influential wizarding family, as his uncle Tiberius was an important official in the Ministry of Magic and was friendly with the head of the Auror Office and later Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour. Tiberius took his nephew hunting Nogtails on at least one occasion, with Scrimgeour and Bertie Higgs in Norfolk.\\n\\n\\n====Early years====\\nCormac McLaggen started his education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1990 and was Sorted into Gryffindor, along with Katie Bell who also was a Sorted Gryffindor that year. Cormac was a skilled flyer on a broom and Quidditch player, specifically playing the position of Keeper.\\n\\n\\n====Sixth year====\\nMcLaggen at the Keeper try-outs standing next to Ron Weasley\\nIn 1995–1996 school year, McLaggen\\'s sixth year at Hogwarts, he ate a pound of poisonous Doxy eggs on a bet to prove his bravery. This foolhardy decision kept him from joining the Gryffindor Quidditch team, something he cared a great deal about. With Oliver Wood\\'s graduation at the end of the 1993–1994 school year and the Triwizard Tournament cancelling all Quidditch matches the following year, the Gryffindor team was in need of a Keeper at the beginning of the 1995–1996 school year. Unfortunately for McLaggen, he was in the Hospital Wing being treated for doxy egg poisoning at the time of the trials, and Ron Weasley was made Keeper instead.\\n\\n\\n====Seventh year====\\nThe following year, McLaggen\\'s last, he met Professor Horace Slughorn on the Hogwarts Express. Because of his well-connected uncle Tiberius, McLaggen was invited to be a member of the Slug Club.\\nMcLaggen attending a Slug Club dinner party\\nSoon after his seventh year began, McLaggen tried out for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, but he managed to make only four out of five saves. This was because Hermione Granger, who overheard McLaggen making rude remarks about Ron and Ginny Weasley, had dishonestly placed a Confundus Charm on him. McLaggen angrily asked team captain Harry Potter for another try, but Harry refused, and Ron was given the position of Keeper again, as he beat McLaggen in saves.\\nIn December, McLaggen attended Professor Slughorn\\'s Christmas party with Hermione, who was also a member of the Slug Club. The evening did not go well for him, however, as Hermione only asked him out to get back at Ron dating Lavender Brown to spite her. McLaggen ended up driving her crazy by talking about himself excessively, boasting about his Quidditch abilities, and being too forward romantically. She avoided him for most of the night to talk to Harry and Luna Lovegood. McLaggen asked Harry if he had seen her later, which Harry denied, and was irritated to find that she had left. After eating a foul tasting dragon tartare, McLaggen vomited on Severus Snape\\'s shoes, earning himself detention for the next month.\\nMcLaggen playing Keeper for Gryffindor after Ron Weasley is poisoned by Draco Malfoy\\nWhen Ron was hospitalised in March, before Gryffindor\\'s second game against Hufflepuff, Harry Potter was forced to play McLaggen as his reserve Keeper. In the week leading up to the match, Harry had his doubts about his new team-mate. Although he was skilled, McLaggen was also bossy and repeatedly tried to advise Harry on game strategy and insulted the other players\\' abilities. The match was a no-holds-barred disaster, as McLaggen spent much more time trying to tell the rest of the team how to play rather than watching the rings, resulting in several goals for the opponent. This culminated in him wrestling a Beater\\'s bat\\xa0away from Jimmy Peakes and attempting to show him how to hit a Bludger, only to knock Harry off his broomstick and crack his skull.\\nThe fiasco was possibly Gryffindor\\'s worst and most embarrassing loss ever (a final score of 320-60), and Ron told Harry in the Hospital Wing that he thought McLaggen\\'s enraged teammates \\'\\'\"might\\'ve dealt with him before you get out of here...\"\\'\\' When Ron recovered, he resumed the Keeper position while Cormac was permanently removed from the team.\\n\\n\\n====Repeat year====\\nCormac and other students are meet by Death Eaters\\nCormac was forced to repeat his final year. When the Death Eaters boarded the train, he foolishly stated that his father would hear about this, but the Death Eaters completely ignored him. \\nCormac joined the revived Dumbledore\\'s Army to oppose the Death Eater teachers Alecto and Amycus Carrow. He later fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and survived the battle.\\n\\n\\n==Physical appearance==\\nMcLaggen was described as a large, wire-haired youth. His face went red whenever he became angry. At the Keeper tryouts in 1996, Harry Potter thought that McLaggen was large enough that he could block all three goal hoops without even moving.\\n\\n\\n==Personality and traits==\\nCormac attempting to intimidate Ron Weasley\\nAggressive, arrogant, and self-righteous, McLaggen epitomised the most negative aspects of the stereotypical Gryffindor characteristics. Though brave, he was foolhardy rather than self-sacrificing. He was also arrogant and pushy and felt a strong sense of entitlement. According to Hermione Granger, McLaggen was rude, insensitive, and over-assertive when making romantic advances. All he did was talk about himself and lacked manners and consideration of others. It was due to this that Hermione remarked that Grawp (Hagrid\\'s giant half-brother) was more mannered than Cormac. \\nMcLaggen also had a bad temper; for example, Harry Potter thought he might punch him for refusing his demand to give him another Quidditch tryout. He also blamed others, doing so with Ginny Weasley for not properly shooting at her brother Ron during Keeper tryouts. When Harry was forced to put McLaggen on the team as a substitute Keeper, McLaggen proved to be a poor team player and a poor Keeper overall. He spent much more time in the match offering unwanted observations of others rather than concentrating on what he was meant to be doing in the game.\\nRegardless of his negative traits, Cormac proved himself quite brave and righteous, willingly joining his allies in the Battle of Hogwarts despite having no obligation to do so, and actually acting as one of the leaders of Dumbledore\\'s Army during Lord Voldemort\\'s reign over Hogwarts, alongside Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood.\\n\\n\\n==Magical abilities and skills==\\nMcLaggen playing as Keeper during a Quidditch match\\n*Flying: Cormac was a very accomplished and talented broomstick flyer, and he joined the Gryffindor Quidditch team as a reserve Keeper in his seventh year, showing his impressive Quidditch skills. \\n*Duelling: Cormac was a very skilled duellist, as he bravely fought in the Battle of Hogwarts against the Death Eaters, and survived. He would have had to have been very proficient with Martial magic to have survived such a bloody and violent conflict.\\n\\n\\n===Hermione Granger===\\nHermione Granger, whom he was infatuated with\\nIn his seventh year, McLaggen became familiar with Hermione Granger when they were both members of the Slug Club. Hermione seemed to think that McLaggen was arrogant and unpleasant, and when she overheard him insult Ron and Ginny Weasley during Quidditch try-outs, she hit him with a Confundus Charm, unbeknownst to him.\\nHowever, when Hermione and Ron later had a row over Ron’s romance with Lavender Brown, she tried to make him jealous by asking McLaggen to attend Professor Slughorn’s Christmas party with her, choosing the person she thought would annoy Ron the most. He accepted, but spent most of the evening boasting about himself, to her irritation. He was very forward with her under the mistletoe, prompting Hermione to abandon him to seek out Harry Potter and Luna Lovegood and to avoid him for the rest of the party. He was very annoyed when he was unable to find her. This indicates that while McLaggen was romantically interested in Hermione, she found him to be a rude braggart.\\n\\n\\n===Harry Potter===\\nAlthough they were in the same House, Harry strongly disliked McLaggen. The two first met in 1996 when they were both questioned by Professor Slughorn. They met again when McLaggen tried out for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, of which Harry was the Captain. It seemed that McLaggen wrongly expected preferential treatment from Harry because the two were both in the Slug Club.\\nWhen Ron Weasley beat McLaggen in saves, he accused Ginny Weasley of purposely giving her brother an advantage. He angrily confronted Harry about it, who coldly refuted the accusations. Harry thought that McLaggen might punch him for a moment. Later in the year, when McLaggen temporarily replaced Ron, he annoyed Harry immensely by repeatedly offering advice on game strategy, and spent so much time ordering around his team-mates and knocking Harry out instead of blocking goals that Gryffindor ultimately lost the match.\\nCormac also disliked Harry because he was best friends with Hermione Granger (whom Cormac fancied). Cormac and Harry also seemed to both represent different aspects of Gryffindor: with Cormac personifying the negative traits such as arrogance and self-righteousness, while Harry embodied the positive traits of chivalry, courage, and having a self-sacrificing nature. However, they both seemed to have nasty tempers.\\n\\n\\n===Ron Weasley===\\nMcLaggen and Ron Weasley took an instant dislike to one another in 1996, when they competed over the Keeper position on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. McLaggen believed that the team Captain, Harry Potter, showed favouritism toward his friend, whereas Harry thought Ron was simply the better player and that McLaggen was far too arrogant to make a decent player.\\nRon’s dislike of McLaggen prompted Hermione Granger to ask him to escort her to Professor Slughorn’s Christmas party, which he did, much to Ron’s displeasure. He was further annoyed when McLaggen took over his position as Keeper after he was poisoned, and relieved when it did not go well.\\n\\n\\n==Etymology==\\nThe name \\'\\'Cormac\\'\\' is borne by a number of figures from Irish legend and history, including Cormac mac Airt, a warrior king of Ireland, and Cormac Cond Longas, an exiled prince of Ulster. The name is most commonly translated as \"charioteer\", but can be also translated into \"raven\"- a bird strongly associated with warfare in Celtic mythology. This may allude to McLaggen\\'s aggressive personality. The name can also be translated to mean \"son of defilement\", from the Gaelic \\'\\'corb\\'\\', \"defilement\", and \\'\\'mac\\'\\', \"son\".\\n\\n\\n==Behind the scenes==\\n*Cormac McLaggen was played by Freddie Stroma in  and the two-part film adaptation of .\\n*In , Cormac is seen on the Hogwarts Express returning to school for the 1997–1998 school year and he also appeared in the Room of Requirement in , however, in the novel of , Cormac was in his seventh and final year (it wasn\\'t mentioned in the film, though). However, because he was constantly thinking up new Quidditch strategies in his final year, it\\'s possible he was doing so bad in his studies that he had to stay back a year. Another possibility is that he was returning to Hogwarts to take his N.E.W.T.S, as all examinations were cancelled in the previous year following the death of Albus Dumbledore.\\n*In the films, Cormac takes part in the Battle of Hogwarts and appears as a member of Dumbledore\\'s Army.\\n*In , Cormac is given a month of detention for throwing up on Snape\\'s shoes (an event that never occurred in the book) because Harry tricked him into believing that the dragon tartare he was eating was dragon testicles, or \\'\\'\"dragon balls\"\\'\\' as Harry called them.\\n*There was a scene with Ron confronting Cormac before the Quidditch match in the film, but it was later removed. This scene was never released.\\n*It is unknown if he is in the same year as Harry in the films; it is possible albeit rather unlikely.\\n*In the film he never knocks Harry out since the Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff was completely omitted.\\n*In the films, Cormac seems to be less obnoxious than in the books.\\n*Due to his joining the DA, and seemingly being a fairly reasonable character, if a bit cocky, in the films, it is rather unclear to people who haven\\'t read the books why Hermione is quite contemptuous of him and his feelings for her.\\n*In  Cormac appears in several scenes but has no speaking lines.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.9259041109473269, 'meta': {'url': 'https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Cormac_McLaggen', 'name': 'Cormac_McLaggen'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '6c58dc3db7b323e5b8acc64b18148728'}>,\n",

During her Hogwarts years, she became close friends with Hermione Granger, Cho Chang, Katie Bell, and Angelina Johnson. In her seventh year, she joined Dumbledore\\'s Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter. In 1998, she returned at Hogwarts in order to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters.\\nIt can be assumed that Alicia survived the final battle of the Second Wizarding War since she was not listed amongst the casualties.

There, she became best friends with fellow Gryffindors Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson, Lee Jordan, Oliver Wood, and the twins Fred and George Weasley who all shared an interest in Quidditch.\\nAlicia tried out for the Gryffindor Quidditch team and made reserve position; according to a comment by Lee Jordan, she was a good pick by Oliver, meaning she had an impressive skill at Quidditch but still only made reserve.\\n\\n\\n====Third year====\\nAlicia standing with the rest of the Gryffindor team before a Quidditch game\\nAlicia was only a reserve on the Gryffindor Quidditch team until 1991, her third year, when she would become a Chaser. Alicia was most often the Chaser who attempts penalty shots for Gryffindor when the other team commits a foul. In 1991, a new Seeker, Harry Potter, joined the team. Alicia became friendly with Harry, too. The Gryffindor Quidditch team won two times during this year, but was defeated by Ravenclaw, costing them their chance at the title. However, Gryffindor House would have had the most points by the end of the year, due to Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Neville Longbottom because of their actions the previous night.\\n\\n\\n====Fourth year====\\nAlicia is present when Draco Malfoy calls Hermione Granger a \"\\'\\'filthy little Mudblood\\'\\'\"\\nAlicia found prejudice based on blood purity extremely offensive, screaming \"how dare you\" when Draco Malfoy called Hermione Granger a \"Mudblood\" in 1992. The Quidditch matches were cancelled in 1992 due to the attacks on the muggle-born students by the Basilisk.\\nHowever, the team had time to play against Slytherin; during the game, a Rogue bludger chased Harry in an unusual way. Alicia was afraid that the Bludger would kill Harry as it was very violent, and told Oliver Wood, the Captain, that they should ask to forfeit the match.\\nKatie, Angelina, and Alicia at the only meeting of the Duelling club after catching Lockhart\\'s cloak\\nDuring this year, she also was a member of the Duelling Club and she attended the first meeting with Katie and Angelina. At the Duelling Club, the three of them fought for Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s cloak that he tossed into the crowd before duelling with Snape. Later during the club meeting she witnessed Harry Potter speak Parseltongue in order to save a fellow student from a snake that Draco Malfoy conjured during his practise duel with him. It is unknown if she was one of the many students who thought that Harry himself was the Heir of Slytherin.\\n\\n\\n====Fifth year====\\nProfessor McGonagall and the residents of Gryffindor Tower\\xa0in the common room after Sirius Black\\'s break-in\\nIn Alicia\\'s fifth year, Wood became more competitive, as Gryffindor had not won the Quidditch Cup in over seven years and he wanted to break the losing streak. During practise, Wood commented on his chasers playing \"superbly\". Gryffindor had originally planned to play Slytherin first, but due to Draco\\'s injury, they faced the\\xa0Hufflepuff team\\xa0instead, captained by\\xa0Cedric Diggory. When Wood spoke of the Hufflepuff Captain Cedric, Katie, Angelina, and Alicia started giggling and commented on Cedric\\'s good looks. The game itself did not go too well, as the players struggled against the terrible weather, and Harry, Gryffindor\\'s Seeker, had passed out in the presence of a Dementor\\xa0and fell from his broom, leaving Cedric to catch the Snitch and Gryffindor to lose the match. Alicia was also present the night that Sirius Black successfully broke into Gryffindor Tower.\\nGryffindor wins the\\xa0Quidditch Cup\\xa0in 1994\\nAlicia and her team later played\\xa0Ravenclaw. Gryffindor were up by eighty points when Ravenclaw started to make a comeback, but Harry caught the Snitch. The final match of the season was against Slytherin and the match was loaded with brutal play. Gryffindor won the match and the Quidditch Cup something that hadn\\'t been achieved since Charlie Weasley played on the team. At the end of Alicia\\'s fifth year, she and her fellow players would bid farewell to Wood as he graduated from Hogwarts. She was also present when the Dementors were removed from school grounds.\\n\\n\\n====Sixth year====\\nDuring her sixth year, the Quidditch matches were cancelled again, due to the Triwizard Tournament. Despite being in the sixth year, it is unknown whether Alicia was old enough to enter her name into the Goblet of Fire. However, the year ended with the death of champion Cedric Diggory and the return of Lord Voldemort.\\n\\n\\n====Seventh year====\\nDuring her seventh and final year Alicia was captained under Angelina Johnson, who replaced Oliver Wood when he left. The team\\'s first Quidditch practise did not very well and resulted in Katie Bell suffering great blood loss. When High Inquisitor Dolores Umbridge inspected Filius Flitwick classes, she asked her how she viewed Flitwick\\'s skills as teacher, and she responded only with positive comments. Disliking Umbridge, Alicia and her friends met up for the meeting at Hog\\'s Head and would then join Dumbledore\\'s Army, an organisation founded by Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger and led by Harry, in order to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts to the students, something that Umbridge did not.\\nAlicia attended as many meetings as she could make without being caught by Umbridge and risking being in detention as the meetings themselves were cutting into what little Quidditch practise she had and she couldn\\'t afford to lose her spare time. At the last meeting before Christmas break, Alicia informed Harry that she and Angelina had found replacements for the team once they had left, Ginny Weasley, Andrew Kirke, and Jack Sloper, she remarks they are not good but will do. In her first meeting, where they practised the Disarming Charm, Alicia was hit hard on the nose by Terry Boot\\'s wand when it went flying across the room.\\n\\n\\n====Battle of Hogwarts====\\nAlicia and the other defenders of Hogwarts witness Harry Potter\\'s final defeat of Voldemort\\nAfter graduating from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry it is unknown what Alicia went on to do, furthering her career in Quidditch is a possibility. But as the Second Wizarding War was at its height she carried her Dumbledore\\'s Army coin around with her, and when the time came in 1998, Neville Longbottom summoned all past and present D.A. members to return to Hogwarts to join the forces in the Battle of Hogwarts fighting against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Alicia returned to Hogwarts with her friends, Oliver Wood, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson and Order of the Phoenix members they informed, Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour.\\n\\n\\n===Later life ===\\nIt can be assumed that she survived the final battle as she was not listed amongst the dead that Harry Potter recognised, nor was her name among the Fallen Fifty. If she survived the battle, her life after the war is unknown.\\n\\n\\n==Personality and traits==\\nAlicia was\\xa0a good-natured and friendly individual\\xa0who was\\xa0very interested in Quidditch. She did\\xa0also care about her friends, as she was afraid for\\xa0Harry Potter\\'s life while a bludger was chasing him. Furthermore, she strongly disliked\\xa0those with pure-blood supremacist views, such as Draco Malfoy, and believed\\xa0that\\xa0no differences exist\\xa0between pure-bloods and muggle-borns, as she screamed to Malfoy \\'\\'\"How dare you!\"\\'\\', when he called Hermione Granger a \\'\\'\"mudblood\"\\'\\'. She was also brave, as she was sorted at Gryffindor house, and was a member of Dumbledore\\'s Army in order to oppose\\xa0Dolores Umbridge. Furthermore, she fought at the Battle of Hogwarts in order to help defeat the Death Eaters and win the final battle, showing her to be very courageous and determined\\xa0indeed.\\xa0\\nAlicia playing Quidditch with Fred and George\\n\\n\\n==Magical abilities and skills==\\n*Flying: Alicia played the position of Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, showing she was an excellent broomstick\\xa0flyer\\xa0and Quidditch\\xa0player. She often took the penalty shots for the team.\\n*Duelling:  Alicia learned how to duel at the Duelling Club in her fourth year. She was also taught both defensive and offensive spells by Harry Potter, while attending meetings of Dumbledore\\'s Army. She later bravely fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and very likely survived, showing her to have been a highly skilful duellist who was proficient with martial magic.\\n*Charms: Alicia was apparently highly talented and proficient with charms, as she took the subject to N.E.W.T.-level, meaning she must have achieved either an \"Outstanding\" or \"Exceeds Expectations\" at Ordinary Wizarding Level.\\n\\n\\n===Gryffindor Quidditch team===\\nThe Gryffindor Quidditch team in 1991\\nAlicia was a member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, during her years at Hogwarts. There, she became best friends with fellow members Angelina Johnson, with whom she possibly shared a dormitory, and Katie Bell, who was a year younger than her. Alicia, Angelina and Katie were also the only girls at the team.\\nShe was also a good friend of the twins Fred and George Weasley. Fred and George liked doing pranks and teasing the others, but defended their friends. When Fred and George were kicked off from the team by Dolores Umbridge, Alicia was very angry with them, as their loss at the team would cost them the Quidditch cup.\\nAnother friend of hers was Lee Jordan. Although he wasn\\'t a member of the team, he was the Quidditch matches commentator, and strongly supported the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Lee liked doing pranks, too.\\nAlicia was also a close friend of Oliver Wood, the Captain of the team. However, they argued several times, as in 1992; Alicia shouted at Oliver, when he wanted Harry to keep on playing, while a Bludger was chasing him. Oliver had been very proud of the team by the end of the year; the year that they eventually won the Quidditch cup.\\nOther members of the team were Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. Harry, the Seeker, was extremely good, but Ron had a lack of confidence, due to the Slytherins making fun of him. Eventually, Ron was proved to be very good, as the members of the team, including Alicia, supported him and advised him not to be bothered by the Slytherins.\\nAlicia seemed to care about Harry, as he was her friend, and she thought he shouldn\\'t keep on playing in 1992, while a Bludger was chasing him. She also went as far as to kiss Harry after he won them a match against Ravenclaw (along with Angelina and Katie). Alicia also became a member of Dumbledore\\'s Army, in order to be taught Defence Against the Dark Arts by Harry, and she later fought at the Battle of Hogwarts, alongside Harry and the other members of the team.\\n\\n\\n===Dumbledore\\'s Army===\\nAlicia became a member of Dumbledore\\'s Army in her seventh year. It was an organisation founded by Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and led by Harry, in order to teach the members Defence Against the Dark Arts, something that professor Dolores Umbridge did not. Furthermore, they wanted to oppose Umbridge. Alicia was rather friendly with the most of them.\\nShe appeared to be a close friend of Hermione Granger, a Gryffindor girl two years younger than her. Alicia defended Hermione when Draco Malfoy insulted her. When Malfoy called Hermione a “mudblood”, Alicia screamed “HOW DARE YOU!” to Malfoy. Alicia and Hermione fought together at the Battle of Hogwarts.\\nAlicia would have been on good terms with fellow Gryffindors Neville Longbottom, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, Lavender Brown, Parvati Patil, Colin and Dennis Creevey. Other members of the army were Justin Finch-Fletchley, Susan Bones, Terry Boot, Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, Zacharias Smith, Ernie Macmillan, Hannah Abbott, Cho Chang, Padma Patil, Marietta Edgecombe and Luna Lovegood. Alicia would have disliked Marietta Edgecombe, who betrayed the army to Umbridge, and Zacharias Smith, who abandoned the army during the Battle of Hogwarts.\\n\\n\\n==Behind the scenes==\\n*Alicia Spinnet\\'s ethnicity is unknown as it was never clearly described or stated in the books.\\n*Alicia Spinnet was portrayed by Leilah Sutherland in \\'\\'Harry Potter and the Philosopher\\'s Stone\\'\\' and by Rochelle Douglas for \\'\\'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\'\\'. If Alicia appeared in latter films, none of the actresses or extras were credited. \\n*None of the actresses who previously portrayed Alicia have been asked to reprise the role for any of the other films, nor have any new ones been recast. She did not appear in the Battle of Hogwarts scene in the \\'\\'Deathly Hallows\\'\\' film.\\n*Out of the three Chasers who played for Gryffindor during Harry\\'s first five years at Hogwarts, Alicia is the only one to not be injured during a Quidditch match in any of the films (Angelina crashed into the stands in \\'\\'Philosopher\\'s Stone\\'\\' and Katie\\'s broom caught fire in \\'\\'Prisoner of Azkaban\\'\\'). She is also the only member of the original Gryffindor team to never have a speaking role in any of the films.\\n\\n\\n==Etymology==\\nAlicia is related to Alice and ultimately the German Adalheid, meaning \"noble type (of person) also kind and beauty.\" The last name really exists and is often spelled Spinnett. A spinet a small upright piano. Alicia\\'s name also may be a variation of spinner or spinney, a small grove of trees.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.9255934414762682, 'meta': {'url': 'https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Alicia_Spinnet', 'name': 'Alicia_Spinnet'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'fc7181e08b4d1a20eb623acee3568971'}>,\n",
       "  <Document: {'content': 'Marcus Flint (b. 1975/1976) was a wizard who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1987 to 1994 and was sorted into Slytherin house. He was a Chaser on the Slytherin Quidditch team, as well as its Captain from at least 1991 to 1994. \\n\\n\\n===Early life===\\nMarcus was born in September 1975 to August 1976 in Great Britain. He was a descendant of the pure-blood Flint family and perhaps related in some way to former Minister for Magic, Josephina Flint and Ursula Black (née Flint). It is unknown if Marcus himself was a pure-blood.\\n\\n\\n====Early years====\\nMarcus and other Slytherins playing a game of Quidditch\\nFlint began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1987 and was Sorted into Slytherin House. He lived in a dormitory in the Slytherin Dungeon, and his Head of House was the Potions Master, Professor Severus Snape.\\nAt some point, he joined the Slytherin Quidditch team as a Chaser and became its captain by his fifth year. Flint was known for being very rough and often brutal in his Quidditch-playing; for example, his handshakes with Gryffindor Captain and rival Oliver Wood often turned into attempts to break one another\\'s fingers. He was also not above committing fouls, blocking Harry Potter in a 1991 Quidditch match.\\n\\n\\n====Sixth year====\\nIn 1992, Flint was pleased when his team received new broomsticks, courtesy of Lucius Malfoy, when his son Draco became the team\\'s new Seeker. They bragged to the Gryffindor Quidditch team about this and mocked their rivals\\' older brooms. This prompted Hermione Granger to insult Draco, remarking that \"\\'\\'at least no one on the Gryffindor team had to \\'\\'buy\\'\\' their way in\\'\\'\". Draco retaliated by calling Hermione a \"\\'\\'filthy little Mudblood\\'\\'\" to the outrage of the Gryffindors. Flint had to stand in front of Draco to prevent Fred and George Weasley from attacking and injuring his Seeker. Ron Weasley then attempted to curse Draco, but it backfired, and the entire Slytherin team laughed uproariously as Ron vomited slugs. \\nFlint was angered by Draco\\'s stupidity during a match against Gryffindor. He reprimanded him after the game because Draco failed to notice the Golden Snitch next to him, causing Slytherin to lose the match. This was witnessed by George Weasley.\\n\\n\\n====Seventh year====\\nDuring Flint\\'s final year, he participated in a scheme to scare Harry Potter with Draco, Vincent Crabbe, and Gregory Goyle. The four Slytherins dressed up as Dementors, which were guarding Hogwarts that year due to Sirius Black\\'s escape from Azkaban. Following their cruel prank, Professor Minerva McGonagall took fifty House points from Slytherin and sentenced all four of them to detention as punishment. During the Quidditch final between Gryffindor and Slytherin that year, Flint played unscrupulously yet again against the rival team, smashing into Angelina Johnson with his broom, which resulted in Fred Weasley throwing his Beater\\'s bat at his head, smashing his nose against his broom handle and causing it to bleed. Flint later managed during the game to score a goal against Gryffindor, but Harry caught the Golden Snitch, allowing Gryffindor to win the game and to gain the Quidditch Cup at last.\\n\\n\\n===Later Life===\\nIt is unknown what happened to Flint after he graduated Hogwarts and what his status was during the Second Wizarding War.\\nDuring the 2010s, Flint\\'s younger self appeared as a Foundable during the Calamity, clad in his Slytherin Quidditch uniform and entrapped by a magical fire Confoundable. Volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force were able to free him by casting the Water-Making Spell, allowing Flint to return to his original time.\\n\\n\\n==Physical appearance==\\nFlint\\'s unappealing physical appearance\\nMarcus was described as being tall and relatively muscular. Harry Potter also mentioned that he looked like he might have troll blood in him. However, this may simply have been an insult toward Flint\\'s appearance.\\n\\n\\n==Personality and traits==\\nFlint did not follow good sportsmanship when playing Quidditch, despite his position as Captain of his team. He allowed Draco Malfoy to join the team when bribed with the new Nimbus 2001 broomsticks. Flint also resorted frequently to foul play, such as blocking Harry Potter in 1991 and trying to scare him by disguising as a Dementor in 1993. He seemed to find the misfortunes of others amusing as he laughed when Ron\\'s Slug-vomiting Charm backfired on himself. When Draco failed to notice the Snitch floating above his head, leading the team to lose, Flint yelled at the new Seeker rather harshly for his foolishness. It was unknown how he viewed the importance of blood status, though he seemed to approve of when Draco called Hermione a mudblood and even defended him from harm afterwards, implying he may have held some prejudice towards Muggle-borns or that he was a pure-blood supremacist, similar to many other Slytherin students.\\n\\n\\n==Magical abilities and skills==\\n*Flying: Marcus played as a Chaser on the Slytherin Quidditch team. He was the Captain from at least his fifth year to his seventh year, demonstrating he was an accomplished and skilled broomstick flyer and Quidditch player, despite his frequent cheating and foul play on the Quidditch pitch.\\n\\n\\n==Etymology==\\n*The name Marcus is derived from Mars, the god of war in Roman mythology. This may allude to Flint\\'s aggression. It is interestingly the opposite of Oliver Wood\\'s name, which means \"olive tree\", ultimately symbolising Wood\\'s peaceful nature. \\n*A flint is a stone used for lighting a fire. Once again, this alludes to his relationship with Oliver Wood; flint is kindling fire, and wood burns when in contact with fire.\\n\\n\\n==Behind the scenes==\\nMarcus as a LEGO minifigure (first edition)\\nMarcus Flint as a LEGO mini-figure (second edition)\\n*Flint was originally stated to be a sixth-year in , yet he was still at the school in  (two years after his debut). J. K. Rowling explained this by saying that he had to repeat his last year because he failed his exams the first time round. This explanation did not deter some fans from noticing other consistency errors with Flint\\'s schooling years. However, in later editions of , Flint is stated to be a fifth year, presumably to clear confusion and the need for a repeated year.\\n*Flint was portrayed by Will Theakston in the first film and Jamie Yeates in the second film, and both wore a set of false teeth for the role.\\n*Flint once borrowed  from the Hogwarts Library and was due to return the book on 22 June.\\n*If Stan Shunpike attended Hogwarts, he would have been in the same year as Marcus Flint.\\n*In , Marcus Flint is the Slytherin team\\'s Seeker.\\n*He was referred to as \"Captain Flint\" because he was captain of the Slytherin Quidditch Team. This may be an allusion to the similarly-named captain of the pirate ship \\'\\'Walrus\\'\\' from Robert Louis Stevenson\\'s novel \\'\\'Treasure Island\\'\\'.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.9247409860462622, 'meta': {'url': 'https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Marcus_Flint', 'name': 'Marcus_Flint'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'd0f07a85e530f14ce196c7d80c7a84a6'}>],\n",
